development of single - stranded dna aptamers for specific bisphenol a detection .. the development of reagents with high affinity and specificity to small molecules is crucial for the high - throughput detection of chemical compounds , such as toxicants or pollutants . aptamers are short and single - stranded ( ss ) oligonucleotides able to recognize target molecules with high affinity . here , we report the selection of ssdna aptamers that bind to bisphenol a ( bpa ), an environmental hormone . using selex process , we isolated high affinity aptamers to bpa from a 10 ( 15 ) random library of 60 mer ssdnas . the selected aptamers bound specifically to bpa , but not to structurally similar molecules , such as bisphenol b with one methyl group difference , or 4 , 4 '- bisphenol with 2 methyl groups difference . using these aptamers , we developed an aptamer - based sol - gel biochip and detected bpa dissolved in water . this novel bpa aptamer - based detection can be further applied to the universal and high - specificity detection of small molecules .	0
treatment of landfill leachate by electrochemical oxidation and anaerobic process .. the removal performance of typical refractory organic compounds in landfill leachate was investigated during the electrochemical ( ec ) oxidation and anaerobic process combined treatment system in this paper . the results indicated that the treatment of landfill leachate by the combined system was highly effective . the toxicity of leachate was notably decreased after the electrochemical oxidation process and the biodegradability was improved . the concentration of the organic acid with low molecular weight in the leachate increased from 28 % to 90 % based on the biodegradability assays after the ec oxidation process . the anaerobic digestion could further remove the residual organic compounds . at a hydraulic retention time ( hrt ) of 16 hours and an organic loading rate ( olr ) of 8 kg cod / m3 d , the concentration of cod , ss , alk , va , n - tkn , n - nh4 + and p - po4 ( 3 )- [ corrected ] in uasb effluent were 532 , 12 , 6744 , 400 , 540 , 455 and 11 . 6 mg / l , respectively , with approximately 90 % removal efficiency of cod . the organic compounds in the landfill leachate revealed different degradation characteristics in the combined system . p - chloroaniline , bisphenol a , 6 - methyl - 2 - phenyl - quinoline , dimethylnaphthaline and n '-( 2 - methyl - 4 - chlorophenyl )- n - cyclohexyformamidine , classified into the first group in this paper , were completely removed by the ec oxidation and did not reappear in the effluent of the uasb reactor . phenylacetic acid , 3 - methyl - indole and n - cyclohexyl - acetamide , called the second group , were completely removed , but reappeared in the uasb reactor . 4 - methyl - phenol , 3 , 4 - dihydroisoquinoline , 2 ( 3h )- benzothiazolone , exo - 2 - hydroxycineole and benzothiazole , the third group , were degraded little in the ec oxidation process , but extensively removed by the anaerobic process . benzoic acid , benzenepropanoic acid and 2 - cyano - 3 , 5 - dimethyl - 1 - hydroxypyrrole , the fourth group , concentration obviously increased in the ec process , but was completely removed in the uasb reactor . the content of volatile fatty acids ( vfas ) markedly increased from 0 . 68 % in the leachate to 16 . 18 % in the effluent from the electrochemical oxidation process ( ec ( effl )). in addition , the degradation rate of organic compounds from the landfill leachate was different in the ec oxidation and anaerobic process .	0
in situ tooth replica custom implant : rationale , material , and technique .. this study introduced a new concept of an in situ , custom - made , tooth replica dental implant . it was obtained by injecting a self - set , nonresorbable polymer type bone graft substitute into the tooth socket after extraction . based on its cited properties , new composite bone cement cortoss was suggested . the properties were reviewed and evaluated . the technique of application was described with a simulation model presented that appeared simple . apparently , immediate duplication of tooth anatomy was achieved ; thus , the concept might have the potentials of spontaneous adaptation and stabilization , preservation of alveolar bone , increasing implant - bone surface area , better load distribution , and bone stimulation . modifications were also described to manage cases of resorbed alveolar bone as well as long - standing extracted teeth . investigations were still required to assess the performance of the material and if modifications would be needed .	0
developmental reprogramming of reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in sheep : native steroids vs . environmental steroid receptor modulators .. the inappropriate programming of developing organ systems by exposure to excess native or environmental steroids , particularly the contamination of our environment and our food sources with synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals that can interact with steroid receptors , is a major concern . studies with native steroids have found that in utero exposure of sheep to excess testosterone , an oestrogen precursor , results in low birth weight offspring and leads to an array of adult reproductive / metabolic deficits manifested as cycle defects , functional hyperandrogenism , neuroendocrine / ovarian defects , insulin resistance and hypertension . furthermore , the severity of reproductive dysfunction is amplified by excess postnatal weight gain . the constellation of adult reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in prenatal testosterone - treated sheep is similar to features seen in women with polycystic ovary syndrome . prenatal dihydrotestosterone treatment failed to result in similar phenotype suggesting that many effects of prenatal testosterone excess are likely facilitated via aromatization to oestradiol . similarly , exposure to environmental steroid imposters such as bisphenol a ( bpa ) and methoxychlor ( mxc ) from days 30 to 90 of gestation had long - term but differential effects . exposure of sheep to bpa , which resulted in maternal levels of 30 - 50 ng / ml bpa , culminated in low birth weight offspring . these female offspring were hypergonadotropic during early postnatal life and characterized by severely dampened preovulatory lh surges . prenatal mxc - treated females had normal birth weight and manifested delayed but normal amplitude lh surges . importantly , the effects of bpa were evident at levels , which approximated twice the highest levels found in human maternal circulation of industrialized nations . these findings provide evidence in support of developmental origin of adult reproductive and metabolic diseases and highlight the risk posed by exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals .	1
transfer of maternally injected endocrine disruptors through breast milk during lactation induces neonatal calbindin - d9k in the rat model .. the uterus is a highly estrogen - responsive tissue , which can be measured through changes in cabp - 9k expression . in this study , we investigated the potential for estrogenic compounds 4 - tert - octylphenol ( op ), nonylphenol ( np ), bisphenol a ( bpa ), diethylstilbestrol ( des ) and 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) to be transferred through breast milk from dam to neonate during lactation using the induction of cabp - 9k in uterine tissue as a biomarker . dams were treated with op , np and bpa , dissolved in corn oil , at doses of 200 , 400 and 600 mg / kg body weight per day l for 5 days after delivery . dams and neonates were euthanized after 24h . treatment with these estrogenic compounds increased the expression of cabp - 9k mrna in the maternal uterus , in a dose - dependent manner . all doses of estrogenic compounds resulted in an increase in cabp - 9k protein levels . these compounds have an estrogenic effect on the maternal uterus during the lactation period as shown by the induction of both cabp - 9k mrna and protein . in the neonatal uterus , the expression of cabp - 9k mrna and protein significantly increased with des exposure . there was a significant increase in cabp - 9k mrna in neonatal uterus when the dams were treated with high doses of estrogenic compounds , but protein levels of cabp - 9k were undetectable . taken together , these findings suggest that maternally injected estrogenic compounds may be transferred to neonates through breast milk and thus affecting uterine function , as shown by the induction of cabp - 9k gene expression in the neonatal uterus .	0
effect of dentine on release of tegdma from resin composite in vitro .. triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ) is a component of some resin composites which contributes to their cytotoxicity . the presence of dentine between resin composite and test cells reduces the cytotoxicity in vitro . to determine why dentine has this protective effect , the diffusion of tegdma from a composite resin through dentine to the pulp space was compared with release directly into aqueous solution in vitro . both release rate and total cumulative release of tegdma for the two groups , at times up to 100 days , were determined using reversed - phase hplc . release rate directly into water was highest in the minutes immediately after immersion and declined thereafter . however , in the tooth model , using an equivalent mass and surface area of composite resin , no tegdma was detectable in the pulp space until 43 min after restoration placement . the rate of diffusion through dentine from that time until day 1 was less than 1 % of the highest ( initial ) direct release rate . the rate declined thereafter . it is relevant , however , that by day 3 the total cumulative release of tegdma through dentine was 60 % of the direct release . dentine therefore appears to exert its protective effect principally by retarding or ' damping ' the initial high release of tegdma to a substantial degree .	0
highly potent binding and inverse agonist activity of bisphenol a derivatives for retinoid - related orphan nuclear receptor rorγ .. the plastic chemical bisphenol a ( bpa ) has recently been suspected to be a base structure of endocrine disrupting chemicals , which achieve their adverse effects by interfering with human nuclear receptors . for instance , bpa , bisphenol af , and tetrabromo - or tetrachloro - bpa ( x₄ - bpa ) have been characterized as binders for errγ , er , and pparγ , respectively . this ongoing string of findings has led to apprehension that some other bpa derivatives might also perturb important human nuclear receptors . the retinoid - related orphan receptor rorγ has been strongly suspected to be a target of highly hydrophobic chemical substances because of its extreme affinity for lipophilic sterols . in the present study , we tested a series of bpa derivatives for their ability to bind to rorγ , and identified two distinctly potent derivatives having isopropyl or sec - butyl groups at positions adjacent to the bpa - 4 - hydroxyl group . in particular , di - sec - butyl - bpa has emerged as a considerably potent ligand ( ic₅₀ )= 146 nm ). in the reporter gene assay , these compounds suppressed the basal constitutive transcriptional activity originally induced by wild - type rorγ . the present results strongly suggested that rorγ , and perhaps also rorα and rorβ , binds highly hydrophobic and sterically hindered chemical substances , inducing some unspecified physiological and biochemical disruptions .	1

the effect of three polishing systems on the surface roughness of four hybrid composites : a profilometric and scanning electron microscopy study .. a highly polished composite restoration is necessary to help promote a plaque - free environment . in this study the polishability of four hybrid composites ( pertac , aph , herculite , and z100 ) was compared after finishing and polishing with the caulk enhance polishing kit , kerr composite finishing kit , and the espe mfs / mps polishing kit . profilometric evaluation revealed that the mfs / mps polishing system gave a superior polish for z100 , herculite , and pertac ; the enhance polishing system demonstrated the poorest polish with all four composites tested . there were no significant differences among the four composites when polished with each of the three polishing systems .	0
bond strength of a light - cured and two auto - cured glass ionomer liners .. ninety - nine extracted human molar teeth were used in this study comparing the shear bond strengths on dentine of one light - cured and two auto - cured polyalkenoate ( glass ionomer ) cements . bond strength can be influenced by differences in tooth structure . a balanced - incomplete block design ( hull and nie , 1981 ) was used to reduce variation attributable to such differences . cements were applied to paired dentine surfaces in combinations such that 66 tooth sides were treated with each material . a light - cured dentinal adhesive and composite resin restorative material were then placed and shear bond strength testing was conducted exactly 24 h after the completion of each specimen . mean forces ( mpa ) for the three materials were compared using an appropriate analysis of variance model ( balanced - incomplete - blocks ) the shear bond strengths ( mpa ) of the light - cured liner ( espe , seefeld / oberbay , frg ) was 4 . 71 +/- 1 . 16 . vitrabond showed the greatest variance of all three materials tested , however this material ' s average bond strength was greater than the maximum achieved for the other materials . student - newman - keuls comparison of means showed that all cements differed significantly from each other ( alpha = 0 . 05 ). it is concluded that the light - cured glass ionomer liner exhibited significantly better shear bond strength performance than the two auto - cured glass ionomers tested .	0
organic diagenesis in sediment and its impact on the adsorption of bisphenol a and nonylphenol onto marine sediment .. hydrophobic organic contaminants in marine water are mostly adsorbed onto ( partitioned into ) sediment organic matter ( som ). to study the impact of som diagenesis on sediment adsorption properties , artificial sediment with rich som content was incubated for more than 120 days . the sediment was sampled every week , and batch sediment adsorption tests were conducted with bisphenol a ( bpa ) and nonylphenol ( np ) as the model pollutants . the results show that the amount of organic matter loaded in the sediment decreased by nearly 80 % during incubation . for the incubated sediment , the bpa partition coefficient , kd , decreased whereas the organic normalized partition coefficient , koc , more than doubled . the experiments with np show an even greater increase in koc . organic matter diagenesis shows a profound effect on the adsorption behavior of sediment , as the som residue has an increasing affinity and partition capacity for organic contaminants .	0
"""shear bond strengths of one - bottle adhesives to oil - contaminated enamel .. purpose : to evaluate resin bond strength to enamel contaminated with handpiece oil . materials and methods : bovine teeth were randomly assigned to six groups of 20 teeth each for treatment with one of six different bonding systems ( five one - bottle and one multibottle ). for each system , 10 enamel specimens were contaminated with handpiece oil before acid - etching and 10 were contaminated after acid - etching . the enamel was etched for 15 seconds using 35 % phosphoric acid . following adhesive application , composite resin was bonded using a gelatin capsule technique . shear bond strengths from the two contaminated groups were compared to bond strengths to uncontaminated enamel obtained from a previous study that was performed by the same group of investigators , using the same facility , materials , and methods . results : two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) showed that the factor """" surface contamination """" did not have a significant effect on bond strength ( p > . 542 ). the type of adhesive and the interaction of adhesive and surface contamination were significant ( p < . 0001 and p < . 003 , respectively ). when oil was applied before etching , mean bond strengths ranged from 18 . 0 +/- 4 . 8 mpa for optibond solo ( kerr corp ., orange , california ) to 25 . 3 +/- 5 . 6 mpa for tenure quik with fluoride ( den - mat corp ., santa maria , california ). with oil applied after etching , bond strengths ranged from 18 . 4 +/- 8 . 0 mpa for tenure quik with fluoride to 27 . 4 +/- 5 . 4 mpa for single bond ( 3m dental products , st . paul , minnesota ). for the same adhesive , comparing uncontaminated and """" oil - before - etch """" contaminated groups , the only statistically significant difference in bond strengths was for optibond solo : 21 . 8 +/- 4 . 0 mpa ( uncontaminated ) versus 18 . 0 +/- 4 . 8 mpa ( oil before etch ). comparing uncontaminated and """" oil - after - etch """" groups , the only statistically significant difference was for tenure : 24 . 5 +/- 5 . 7 mpa ( uncontaminated ) and 18 . 4 +/- 8 . 0 mpa ( oil after etch )."""	0

antibacterial activity of different generation dentin - bonding systems .. objectives : the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of different generation dentin - bonding systems . method and materials : the antibacterial activities of dentin - bonding systems optibond fl primer , single bond , clearfil se bond primer , and prompt - l - pop were evaluated against streptococcus mutans , streptococcus salivarius , lactobacillus casei , and lactobacillus acidophilus . cervitec ( 1 % chlorhexidine varnish ) was also examined as a positive control material . disk diffusion tests with filter paper disks ( n = 10 ) containing a drop of each material ( 20 microl ) were used . after incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 hours , the growth inhibition zones were measured in millimeters . results : of all the materials tested , optibond fl primer , clearfil se bond primer , and prompt - lpop showed larger growth inhibition zones than the control material for all bacterial strains . no antibacterial effect was noted for single bond . the results indicated that optibond fl primer had the strongest effect against the s mutans and l casei , and clearfil se bond primer produced the largest inhibition zone for s salivarius and l acidophilus among the test materials . conclusion : the antibacterial effects observed for the tested different generation dentin - bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials .	0
effects of chemical cross - linkers on caries - affected dentin bonding .. the achievement of a strong and stable bond between composite resin and dentin remains a challenge in restorative dentistry . over the past two decades , dental materials have been substantially improved , with better handling and bonding characteristics . however , little attention has been paid to the contribution of collagen structure / stability to bond strength . we hypothesized that the induction of cross - linking in dentin collagen improves dentin collagen stability and bond strength . this study investigated the effects of glutaraldehyde - and grape seed extract - induced cross - linking on the dentin bond strengths of sound and caries - affected dentin , and on the stability of dentin collagen . our results demonstrated that the application of chemical cross - linking agents to etched dentin prior to bonding procedures significantly enhanced the dentin bond strengths of caries - affected and sound dentin . glutaraldehyde and grape seed extract significantly increased dentin collagen stability in sound and caries - affected dentin , likely via distinct mechanisms .	0
bisphenol a exposure disrupts genomic imprinting in the mouse .. exposure to endocrine disruptors is associated with developmental defects . one compound of concern , to which humans are widely exposed , is bisphenol a ( bpa ). in model organisms , bpa exposure is linked to metabolic disorders , infertility , cancer , and behavior anomalies . recently , bpa exposure has been linked to dna methylation changes , indicating that epigenetic mechanisms may be relevant . we investigated effects of exposure on genomic imprinting in the mouse as imprinted genes are regulated by differential dna methylation and aberrant imprinting disrupts fetal , placental , and postnatal development . through allele - specific and quantitative real - time pcr analysis , we demonstrated that maternal bpa exposure during late stages of oocyte development and early stages of embryonic development significantly disrupted imprinted gene expression in embryonic day ( e ) 9 . 5 and 12 . 5 embryos and placentas . the affected genes included snrpn , ube3a , igf2 , kcnq1ot1 , cdkn1c , and ascl2 ; mutations and aberrant regulation of these genes are associated with imprinting disorders in humans . furthermore , the majority of affected genes were expressed abnormally in the placenta . dna methylation studies showed that bpa exposure significantly altered the methylation levels of differentially methylated regions ( dmrs ) including the snrpn imprinting control region ( icr ) and igf2 dmr1 . moreover , exposure significantly reduced genome - wide methylation levels in the placenta , but not the embryo . histological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed that these epigenetic defects were associated with abnormal placental development . in contrast to this early exposure paradigm , exposure outside of the epigenetic reprogramming window did not cause significant imprinting perturbations . our data suggest that early exposure to common environmental compounds has the potential to disrupt fetal and postnatal health through epigenetic changes in the embryo and abnormal development of the placenta .	0
gene expression of ribosomal protein mrna in chironomus riparius : effects of endocrine disruptor chemicals and antibiotics .. ribosomal protein genes are essential for cellular development . to examine the effects of ribosomal protein genes under various cellular stress conditions in chironomids , ribosomal protein s3 ( rps3 ) and s6 ( rps6 ) cdna from chironomus riparius were characterized and their expression was analyzed during development . a comparative and phylogenetic study among different orders of insects was carried out by analysis of sequence databases . c . riparius rps3 was highly conserved at the protein level and shared over 85 % amino acid identity with homologous sequences from other insects . rps6 also showed approximately 80 % amino acid identity . the rps3 and s6 transcripts were present during different developmental stages but were most abundant during the embryonic stage . furthermore , expression of the previously reported ribosomal proteins rpl11 , l13 , and l15 , as well as rps3 and s6 was analyzed following exposure to various concentrations of three endocrine disruptor chemicals ( edcs ), di ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate , bisphenol a , and 4 - nonylphenol ( 4np ), and the veterinary antibiotics ( vas ) fenbendazole , sulfathiazole , and lincomycin . only rps3 gene expression was up - regulated significantly in response to edcs and fenbendazole . however , the c . riparius ribosomal proteins showed a limited response to cellular stress , following exposure to edcs and vas .	0
bisphenol a from dental polycarbonate crown upregulates the expression of htert .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is one of the endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) that possess estrogen - like biologic activity . many dental materials have been reported to release bpa . however , there are few reports available on the release of bpa from dental polycarbonates . the purpose of this study was to investigate the release of bpa from dental polycarbonate crowns and to evaluate the estrogenic activity of bpa . polycarbonate crowns were immersed in five solvents ( water , ethanol , n - hepthane , acetic acid , and acetonitrile ) at 37 or 65 degrees c for 24 h . the elution from the material was analyzed by high - performance liquid - chromatography ( hplc ) and mass - spectrometry ( ms ) analysis . bpa release was detected corresponding to the degradation of dental polycarbonates under the some storage conditions ( ethanol , acetic acid , and acetonitrile ). a previous report proved that estrogen increased human telomerase catalytic subunit ( htert ) mrna , whereas the effect of edcs on the htert promoter has never been reported . the estrogenic activity of bpa was analyzed by luciferase assay with the use of the htert promoter . this assay revealed that bpa was a positive regulator of htert transcription . in addition , quantitative real - time pcr analysis showed that bpa increased the expression level of htert mrna in mcf7 cells . herein , it is demonstrated that htert is a new target of bpa .	0

in vitro comparison of mechanical properties and degree of cure of a self - adhesive and four novel flowable composites .. purpose : to compare a self - adhesive with two low - shrinkage and two regular flowable resin - based composites ( rbcs ) in terms of degree of conversion ( dc ) as well as micromechanical ( indentation modulus [ e ]; vickers hardness [ hv ]) and macromechanical properties ( flexural strength [ σ ], modulus of elasticity [ eflexural ]). materials and methods : dc was investigated by an atr - ftir spectrometer at clinically relevant filling depths ( 0 . 1 mm , 2 mm , 4 mm , 6 mm bulk , 6 mm incremental ) and irradiation times ( 10 s , 20 s , 40 s ). micro - and macromechanical properties were measured with an automatic microhardness indenter and a three - point bending test device after curing the specimens for 20 s and storing them in distilled water for 24 h at 37 ° c . fillers were visualized using a field emission scanning electron microscope ( fe - sem ). results were evaluated using one - way anova , tukey ' s hsd post - hoc test , pearson ' s correlation and a multivariate analysis ( α = 0 . 05 ). a weibull analysis was used to assess σ . results : n ' durance dimer flow ( 65 . 66 %) reached the highest dc ( at 2 mm depth , 20 s irradiation ). in terms of macromechanical properties , ecusphere - flow ( 129 . 82 mpa ) for σ and synergy d6 flow ( 3 . 74 gpa ) for eflexural reached the highest values . the highest micromechanical properties were measured for the self - adhesive rbc ( vertise flow ; e = 10 . 81 gpa , hv = 60 . 20 n / mm2 ). reliability was highly influenced by filler weight ( η2 = 0 . 77 ) and volume ( η2 = 0 . 99 ) proportion . conclusion : in the present study , the self - adhesive rbc showed the highest reliability , highest dc ( together with one of the low - shrinkage rbcs ), and highest micromechanical properties as well as good macromechanical properties . moreover , a curing time of 40 s and an incremental thickness not exceeding 2 mm appeared to be necessary for such results .	0
effect of polyacrylic acid on the interface and bond strength of self - adhesive resin cements to dentin .. purpose : to examine the influence of 11 . 5 % polyacrylic acid pretreatment on the interface and bond strength of self - adhesive resin cements ( maxcem elite , relyx unicem , set ) to dentin . materials and methods : fifty - six third molars were randomly divided into seven groups : relyx arc as control ( arc ), relyx unicem ( rlxu ), maxcem elite ( mce ), set ( st ), polyacrylic acid + relyx unicem ( rlxu - p ), polyacrylic acid + maxcem elite ( mce - p ), and polyacrylic acid + set ( st - p ). resin composite blocks were luted to flat dentin . after storage in distilled water for 24 h , sticks with a cross - sectional area of ca 0 . 80 mm2 were obtained ( n = 24 per group ) and submitted to a microtensile bond strength ( µtbs ) test in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / min . two sets from each group were sectioned mesiodistally in the center of the crown and observed with a scanning electron microscope at 4000x magnification . results : the mean results of the µtbs test ( mpa ) followed by the same letter do not differ statistically significantly according to anova and tukey ' s post - hoc test ( p < 0 . 05 ): arc = 24 . 19 (± 6 . 90 ) a , rlxu - p = 23 . 12 (± 6 . 18 ) a , mce - p = 13 . 09 (± 5 . 87 ) b , rlxu = 10 . 23 (± 2 . 88 ) b , c , and mce = 8 . 14 (± 4 . 63 ) c . all set specimens failed during the cutting procedure . the hybrid layer was not observed for the self - adhesive resin cements , and resin tags were observed for relyx unicem and maxem elite when dentin was pretreated with polyacrylic acid . conclusion : pretreatment with 11 . 5 % polyacrylic acid was effective for bonding relyx unicem and maxcem elite to dentin .	0
dispersive liquid - liquid microextraction versus single - drop microextraction for the determination of several endocrine - disrupting phenols from seawaters .. two liquid - phase microextraction procedures : single - drop microextraction ( sdme ) and dispersive liquid - liquid microextraction ( dllme ), have been developed for the determination of several endocrine - disrupting phenols ( edps ) in seawaters , in combination with high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) with uv detection . the edps studied were bisphenol - a , 4 - cumylphenol , 4 - tertbutylphenol , 4 - octylphenol and 4 - n - nonylphenol . the optimized sdme method used 2 . 5 microl of decanol suspended at the tip of a micro - syringe immersed in 5 ml of seawater sample , and 60 min for the extraction time . the performance of the sdme is characterized for average relative recoveries of 102 +/- 11 %, precision values ( rsd )< 9 . 4 % ( spiked level of 50 ng ml (- 1 )), and detection limits between 4 and 9 ng ml (- 1 ). the optimized dllme method used 150 microl of a mixture acetonitrile : decanol ( ratio 15 . 7 , v / v ), which is quickly added to 5 ml of seawater sample , then subjected to vortex during 4 min and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for another 5 min . the performance of the dllme is characterized for average relative recoveries of 98 . 7 +/- 3 . 7 %, precision values ( rsd )< 7 . 2 % ( spiked level of 20 ng ml (- 1 )), and detection limits between 0 . 2 and 1 . 6 ng ml (- 1 ). the efficiencies of both methods have also been compared with spiked real seawater samples . the dllme method has shown to be a more efficient approach for the determination of edps in seawater matrices , presenting enrichment factors ranging from 123 to 275 , average relative recoveries of 110 +/- 11 %, and precision values ( rsd )< 14 %, when using a real seawaters ( spiked level of 3 . 5 ng ml (- 1 )).	0
two - body wear of dental composites under different loads .. purpose : although dental composites are excellent for restoring the appearance of natural tooth tissues , their relatively poor resistance to wear , especially in approximal and occlusal contact areas , is still a major source of concern . the aim of this research was to study a basic wear mechanism , under 2 - body wear conditions , that may be integrated into our understanding of the in vitro and in vivo wear behavior of dental composites . materials and methods : an in vitro 2 - body wear test was conducted on 2 selected ultrafine compact - filled dental composites under different magnitudes of sinusoidal cyclic load . the wear surfaces and cross sections of the wear layers were assessed using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) to explore the nature of the wear pattern of the dental composites under cyclic loading conditions . results : the wear losses of both composites increased with load . sem analysis of wear surfaces and subsurface sections indicated that the composites tested displayed different wear mechanisms from low to high loads . an explanation for the wear pattern is proposed based on the observed wear behavior . conclusion : the in vitro wear pattern of the ultrafine compact - filled dental composites tested is closely related to the applied load . although the wear loss increased in a roughly linear relationship with applied load , the underlying wear mechanism involved may experience a significant change from low to high load conditions during wear .	0

dietary exposure to chemical migrants from food contact materials : a probabilistic approach .. a two - dimensional probabilistic model has been developed to estimate the short - term dietary exposure of uk consumers to migrants from food packaging materials . the current eu approach uses a default scenario of assuming that all individuals are 60 kg weight and consume 1 kg of food packaged in the material of interest per day . using four uk national dietary and nutrition surveys comprising 4 - 7 day dietary records for different age groups and survey years , a sample representative of the uk population has been obtained consuming around 4200 different food items . each survey provides records for around 2000 individuals and supplies detailed information on the consumption of food and data on sex , height and socio - economic status which may be used to analyse the exposure of selected groups within the community . as a result we are able to address the variation in consumption of food amongst individuals , and account for actual body weights providing a more accurate representation of the ' true ' exposure . the migrants bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ), di - 2 - ethylhexyl adipate ( deha ) and styrene were considered as specimen compounds although the methodology employed has the flexibility to adapt to other migrants and packaging types and indeed other food contaminants . exposure for each individual is estimated by calculating and summing the individual exposure from each item in their diet , and is repeated for all individuals in each survey to produce a distribution of exposures for the population . the packaging type of each food item is assigned by utilizing known packaging types from the database or , by sampling from a distribution based upon market share information . the parameters contributing towards the exposure from a packaged dietary item are migrant concentration and item weight . distributions are used to represent the inherent variation and uncertainty affecting these parameters . where data on concentrations for a particular type of food are lacking , expert judgement is used to extrapolate from available data for other food types . the model can also be run using only migration data for food simulants . in this case , concentrations expected for each of the food items are assigned based on the data for the relevant food simulant . the primary outputs of the model are distributions of estimated daily intakes for the selected population . each distribution gives the variation across the population subject to the uncertain parameters sampled in that iteration of the model . analysing the ensemble of distributions allows us to obtain the confidence limits around estimates for percentiles due to the uncertainties . the probabilistic approach allows sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative importance of the input parameters and places confidence bounds on the outputs to show the effect of the uncertainties and the contribution of each food type toward the overall exposure .	0
softening patterns of post - cure heat - treated dental composites .. the softening of post - cure , heat - treated dental composites in various solutions was evaluated by knoop hardness measurements . the samples were heated at 120 degrees c for 7 min immediately after curing and immersed in various solutions , water , ethanol , heptane and 0 . 1 n naoh . significant increases in hardness were observed for heated samples when compared to unheated samples . the various solutions softened both heated and unheated composites but heated samples were softened to a lesser degree . plots of hardness of heated and unheated samples were nearly parallel , indicating that mechanisms such as penetration of the resin matrix , degradation of the silane coupling agent and fillers may be involved in the softening of both heated and unheated composites . post - cure heat treatment improved the resistance to softening of dental composites .	0
occupational exposure to bisphenol - a ( bpa ) and the risk of self - reported male sexual dysfunction .. background : animal studies have suggested that bisphenol - a ( bpa ) is a potential human endocrine disrupter ; but evidence from human studies is needed . methods : we conducted an occupational cohort study to examine the effect of occupational exposure to bpa on the risk of male sexual dysfunction . current workers from bpa - exposed and control factories were recruited . the exposed workers were exposed to very high bpa levels in their workplace . male sexual function was ascertained through in - person interviews using a standard male sexual function inventory . results : bpa - exposed workers had consistently higher risk of male sexual dysfunction across all domains of male sexual function than the unexposed workers . after controlling for matching variables and potential confounders , exposed workers had a significantly increased risk of reduced sexual desire [ odds ratios ( or ) = 3 . 9 , 95 % confidence interval : 1 . 8 - 8 . 6 ), erectile difficulty ( or = 4 . 5 , 95 % ci 2 . 1 - 9 . 8 ), ejaculation difficulty ( or = 7 . 1 , 95 % ci 2 . 9 - 17 . 6 ), and reduced satisfaction with sex life ( or = 3 . 9 , 95 % ci 2 . 3 - 6 . 6 ). a dose - response relationship was observed with an increasing level of cumulative bpa exposure associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction . furthermore , compared with the unexposed workers , bpa - exposed workers reported significantly higher frequencies of reduced sexual function within 1 year of employment in the bpa - exposed factories . conclusions : our findings provide the first evidence that exposure to bpa in the workplace could have an adverse effect on male sexual dysfunction .	0

disposition of a low dose of bisphenol a in male and female cynomolgus monkeys .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a weak estrogenic compound mass - produced with potential human exposure . following a single oral or intravenous ( iv ) dose of 100 microg / kg [ ring - 14c ( u )] radiolabeled bisphenol a ( 14c - bpa ) to male and female cynomolgus monkeys , 79 - 86 % of the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine over 7 days , and most of the urinary excretion was recovered by 24 h after dosing , a large part of this occurring within 12 h . the fecal excretion of radioactivity over 7 days was minimal ( 1 . 8 - 3 . 1 %). toxicokinetic parameters obtained from plasma 14c - bpa - derived radioactivity during 48 h were c ( max ) = 104 - 107 ng - eq / ml between 0 . 25 and 2 h , and auc ( oral ) = 244 - 265 ng - eq * h / ml after oral dosing . in the case of the iv dose , auc ( iv ) was 377 - 382 ng - eq * h / ml , and the bioavailability was 0 . 66 - 0 . 70 . the terminal elimination half - life was larger post - iv dose ( t ( 1 / 2iv ) = 13 . 5 - 14 . 7 h ) than post - oral dose ( t ( 1 / 2oral ) = 9 . 63 - 9 . 80 h ). after iv dose , the fast - phase half - life ( t ( 1 / 2f )) of total radioactivity was 0 . 61 - 0 . 67 h . the t ( 1 / 2f ) of unchanged 14c - bpa for females ( 0 . 39 h ) was smaller than that for males ( 0 . 57 h ). these results suggested the distribution of lipophilic 14c - bpa in adipose tissue after iv dose , in contrast to first pass metabolism after oral dose . 14c - bpa - derived radioactivity was strongly bound to plasma protein ( f ( p ) = 0 . 055 ). radio - hplc analysis suggested the predominant plasma and urinary metabolites were mono - and diglucuronide of 14c - bpa and unchanged 14c - bpa was very low (< or = 1 . 5 %) after oral dose . these results indicate that the intestinal absorption and metabolism of bpa was rapid and extensive , and the major metabolites , glucuronide conjugates of 14c - bpa , were rapidly excreted into urine in monkeys .	0
fate of nine recycled water trace organic contaminants and metal ( loid ) s during managed aquifer recharge into a anaerobic aquifer : column studies .. water quality changes associated with the passage of aerobic reverse osmosis ( ro ) treated recycled water through a deep anaerobic pyritic aquifer system was evaluated in sediment - filled laboratory columns as part of a managed aquifer recharge ( mar ) strategy . the fate of nine recycled water trace organic compounds along with potential negative water quality changes such as the release of metal ( loid ) s were investigated in large - scale columns over a period of 12 months . the anaerobic geochemical conditions provided a suitable environment for denitrification , and rapid ( half - life < 1 - 25 days ) degradation of the endocrine disrupting compounds ( bisphenol a , 17beta - estradiol , 17alpha - ethynylestradiol ), and iodipamide . however , pharmaceuticals ( carbamazepine and oxazepam ), disinfection by - products ( n - nitrosodimethylamine , n - nitrosomorpholine ) and iohexol did not degrade rapidly ( half - life > 100 days ). high retardation coefficients ( r ) determined for many of the trace organics ( r 13 to 67 ) would increase aquifer residence time and be beneficial for many of the slow degrading compounds . however , for the trace organics with low r values ( 1 . 1 - 2 . 6 ) and slow degradation rates ( half - life > 100 days ), such as n - nitrosodimethylamine , n - nitrosomorpholine and iohexol , substantial biodegradation during aquifer passage may not occur and additional investigations are required . only minor transient increases in some metal ( loid ) concentrations were observed , as a result of either pyrite oxidation , mineral dissolution or ph induced metal desorption , followed by metal re - sorption downgradient in the oxygen depleted zone .	0

developmental exposure to bisphenol a modulates innate but not adaptive immune responses to influenza a virus infection .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is used in numerous products , such as plastic bottles and food containers , from which it frequently leaches out and is consumed by humans . there is a growing public concern that bpa exposure may pose a significant threat to human health . moreover , due to the widespread and constant nature of bpa exposure , not only adults but fetuses and neonates are also exposed to bpa . there is mounting evidence that developmental exposures to chemicals from our environment , including bpa , contribute to diseases late in life ; yet , studies of how early life exposures specifically alter the immune system are limited . herein we report an examination of how maternal exposure to a low , environmentally relevant dose of bpa affects the immune response to infection with influenza a virus . we exposed female mice during pregnancy and through lactation to the oral reference dose for bpa listed by the us environmental protection agency , and comprehensively examined immune parameters directly linked to disease outcomes in adult offspring following infection with influenza a virus . we found that developmental exposure to bpa did not compromise disease - specific adaptive immunity against virus infection , or reduce the host ' s ability to clear the virus from the infected lung . however , maternal exposure to bpa transiently reduced the extent of infection - associated pulmonary inflammation and anti - viral gene expression in lung tissue . from these observations , we conclude that maternal exposure to bpa slightly modulates innate immunity in adult offspring , but does not impair the anti - viral adaptive immune response , which is critical for virus clearance and survival following influenza virus infection .	0

evaluation of the interface between one - bottle bonding agents and dentin by cryopreparation and low - temperature scanning electron microscopy ( ltsem ). a pilot study on perfused dentinal samples .. objectives : dentin bonding samples are generally observed in the high vacuum chamber of an electron microscope only after completion of the bonding procedure fixation , dehydration and drying of the specimens . the purpose of this study was to observe the effect of each step in the application of various one - bottle dentin bonding agents ( dba ) using cryopreparation followed by low - temperature scanning electron microscopy ( ltsem ). methods : prime & bond 2 . 1 ( p & b 2 . 1 ), coltène experimental ( exp .) and syntac single component ( syntac sc ) were applied onto perfused dentin of extracted , human third permanent molar teeth . after acid - etching , rinsing and drying , and following the application of the respective resins , the teeth were fractured at random and plunge - frozen in liquid nitrogen before examination under ltsem . as this method preserves the state of the treated surface at the moment when it is frozen , each step of the application of the dba can be observed as if it were a ' real - time ' procedure . results : acid - etching the dentin resulted in the removal of the smear layer for all materials tested . those one - bottle dbas which recommend the application of two consecutive resin layers ( p & b 2 . 1 and syntac sc ) showed incomplete saturation of the dentinal surface after application of the first layer . with syntac sc the incomplete saturation was more pronounced than with p & b 2 . 1 . the use of exp . resulted in a much more homogeneous coverage of the dentin despite only one layer of resin having been applied . conclusion : it is concluded that cryo - preparation followed by ltsem appears to be a method which allows each stage of the application of dba to be evaluated .	0
effect of commercially available bonding agents impregnated with fibers on bending strength of hybrid resin .. to clarify the mechanical properties of fiber - reinforced hybrid resin bridges , this study evaluated the influence of various bonding agents (( modeling liquid ( ml ), de resin ( de ), bell bond ( be ), mega bond ( mg ), durafil bond ( du ), fluoro bond ( fb ), mac - bond ( mc ), eg bond ( eg ), unifill bond ( un ), single bond ( sn )) impregnated with fibers on bending strength . fb attained the highest bending strength of 570 mpa , whereas sn exhibited the lowest value of 224 mpa , which meant that the bending strength of fb was 2 . 5 times higher than that of sn . results of this study suggested that the bending strength of fiber - reinforced hybrid resin was significantly affected by bonding agents impregnated with fibers . therefore , selection of bonding agent for hybrid resin restoration requires careful consideration of product composition to ensure an optimal bonding agent - fiber combination , thereby imparting improved mechanical properties to the resultant dental restoration .	0
collagen cross linking increases its biodegradation resistance in wet dentin bonding .. purpose : the biodegradation of exposed dentin collagen within the adhesive / dentin ( a / d ) interface is one of the main reasons for composite restoration failures and seriously affects the durability of dental restorations . in the present study , the objective was to investigate whether the inclusion of the cross - linking reagent ( glutaraldehyde , ga ) in the adhesive would increase collagen biodegradation resistance within the a / d interface . materials and methods : the model adhesive consisted of ~ 60 % monomers ( hema / bis - gma , 45 / 55 wt / wt ) and ~ 40 % ethanol as a solvent . 5 % ga was added to the above formulation . after the dentin surfaces were etched for 15 s with 35 % phosphoric acid , rinsed with water and blotted dry , adhesives both with and without ga were applied and polymerized by visible light for 20 s . these a / d specimens were immersed in the biodegradation solution ( prepared by adding 160 mg collagenase in 1 liter of tesca buffer solution ) for up to 30 days after proceeding with the sectioning / fracture to expose the a / d interfaces . the specimens were analyzed using sem and micro - raman spectroscopy . results : sem results indicated that for the adhesive without ga , there were many voids and a loss of collagen fibrils in the a / d interface after being challenged by the biodegradation solution . the raman spectra collected from the interface showed that the amide i of collagen at 1667 cm - 1 obviously decreased , indicating a removal of collagen fibrils during the degradation process . for the adhesive containing ga , the collagen fibrils within the interface did not degrade at all , which was also confirmed by the raman results . conclusion : the results corroborate the previous findings that by using the current adhesive system and wet bonding , the collagen fibrils in the a / d interface are largely unprotected and easily undergo biodegradation . directly including cross - linking agents in the adhesive could protect collagen fibrils from degradation in situ within the a / d interface .	0
bisphenol a in dental sealants and its estrogen like effect .. bisphenol a or bpa - based epoxy resins are widely used in the manufacture of commercial products , including dental resins , polycarbonate plastics , and the inner coating of food cans . bpa is a precursor to the resin monomer bis - gma . during the manufacturing process of bis - gma dental sealants , bisphenol a ( bpa ) might be present as an impurity or as a degradation product of bis - dma through esterases present in saliva . leaching of these monomers from resins can occur during the initial setting period and in conjunction with fluid sorption and desorption over time and this chemical leach from dental sealants may be bioactive . researchers found an estrogenic effect with bpa , bis - dma , and bis - gma because bpa lacks structural specificity as a natural ligand to the estrogen receptor . it generated considerable concern regarding the safety of dental resin materials . this review focuses on the bpa in dental sealants and its estrogen - like effect .	0
influence of incorporation of antibacterial monomer on curing behavior of a dental composite .. a newly developed monomer , methacryloyloxdodecylpyridinium bromide ( mdpb ), has an antibacterial activity against oral streptococci , and this monomer can be active even after being immobilized as one component of a cured composite . the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of incorporation of mdpb on the curing behavior of bis - gma - based composites . depth of cure , degree of cure , light - attenuating effect , and surface hardness of composites incorporating 0 . 4 or 0 . 5 % mdpb were measured and compared with those of a control material without mdpb . depth of cure of composites with mdpb , measured by means of a penetrometer , was greater than for the control ( p < 0 . 05 ). differential thermal analysis showed that composites with mdpb had a significantly greater degree of cure than the control ( p < 0 . 05 ). the light - attenuating effect of mdpb composites was less than for the control ( p < 0 . 05 ). no significant difference between experimental and control was obtained with respect to vickers hardness after both one day ' s and seven days ' storage in water . these results indicate that the incorporation of small quantities of mdpb into bis - gma - based composites did not adversely affect the cure performance . on the contrary , a significant , though small , improvement was observed .	0

introduction of a planar defect in a molecularly imprinted photonic crystal sensor for the detection of bisphenol a .. this paper reports the preparation of a molecularly imprinted inverse opal hydrogel containing a 2d defect layer , by combining the langmuir - blodgett technique and the photonic crystal template method . by coupling the exceptional characteristics of molecularly imprinted polymers , sensitive to the presence of a target molecule , and those of photonic crystals in a single device , we could obtain a defect - embedded imprinted photonic polymer consisting in a three - dimensional , highly - ordered and interconnected macroporous array , where nanocavities complementary to analytes in shape and binding sites are distributed . as a proof of concept , we prepared a three - dimensional macroporous array of poly ( methacrylic acid ) ( pmaa ) containing molecular imprints of bisphenol a ( bpa ) and a planar defect layer consisting in macropores of different size . the optical properties of the resulting inverse opal were investigated using reflection spectroscopy . the defect layer was shown to enhance the sensitivity of the photonic crystal material , opening new possibilities towards the development smart optical sensing devices .	0
the effect of ferrule on the fracture mode of endodontically treated canines restored with fibre posts and metal - ceramic or all - ceramic crowns .. objectives : the aim of this study was to evaluate the fracture mode of endodontically treated canines ( etc ) restored with glass - fibre posts ( gfp ) and either metal - ceramic ( mc ) or all - ceramic ( ac ) crowns , in the presence or absence of 2 mm ferrule height . methods : fifty recently extracted human maxillary canines were endodontically treated and randomly divided into 5 groups of 10 specimens each . four groups ( with or without ferrule ) were restored with gfp , composite cores and either mc or ac crowns . the fifth group with intact etc served as control . teeth were loaded to fracture at a 135 ° angle to their long axis , at a cross - head speed 0 . 5 mm / min . the fracture modes were divided through optical microscopy to repairable and irreparable . statistical analysis was performed by means of the fisher ' s exact test . results : all groups presented brittle fracture following bending deformation . irreparable root fractures were the primary fracture mode independently of ferrule . the percentages (%) of repairable fractures were not statistically significant different amongst the mc and ac restored teeth independently of ferrule . however the 2 mm ferrule was associated to a higher percentage of repairable fractures , especially in teeth restored with ac crowns . conclusions : the percentage (%) of repairable fractures was higher in all - ceramic compared to metal - ceramic etc and in restorations with ferrule , although the differences were not statistically significant . clinical significance : this in vitro study supports evidence that neither the type of crown restoration nor the presence of ferrule affects statistically significantly the mode of fracture of etc restored with gfp .	0
degree of conversion of composites measured by dta and ftir .. objective : differential thermal analysis ( dta ) using a split fiber optic light source has been reported to be a convenient method of measuring the degree of conversion ( dc ) of light - activated composites . the purpose of this study was to compare the results by dta and fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ), and evaluate the usefulness of the dta method . methods : experimental 2 , 2 - bis [ 4 -( 3 - methacryloyloxy - 2 - hydroxypropoxy ) phenyl ] propane - based composites containing sio2 filler and various amounts of triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ) were prepared , and the dc of each composite was determined by dta or ftir with 60s irradiation . the dc of three proprietary composites containing hybrid filler or prepolymerized resin filler were also measured by both methods with 20 or 60s irradiation . the results were analyzed by anova and fisher ' s protected least significant difference test . results : by both dta and ftir , the dc of experimental composites increased as the proportion of tegdma increased , although dta showed 3 - 10 % greater values ( p < 0 . 05 ) than ftir . for proprietary composites that contain hybrid filler , the values by dta were not significantly different from those by ftir at 20s exposure . longer irradiation time resulted in greater dc ( p < 0 . 05 ) for both methods , and dta showed 5 - 7 % greater values than ftir . however , the dc of the composite containing prepolymerized resin filler was 30 % less by ftir than by dta , possibly due to the influence of unpolymerized species in the filler . significance : the dc values determined by dta and ftir showed good agreement for most materials including model composites . in addition , dta may be more useful than ftir to measure the dc of composites containing prepolymerized resin filler .	0
in utero exposure to bisphenol - a and anogenital distance of male offspring .. background : bisphenol - a ( bpa ) is an endocrine disruptor with widespread human exposure . the effect of in utero bpa exposure on human offspring remains largely unknown . methods : anogenital distance ( agd ) of sons of workers who did or did not have occupational bpa exposure during pregnancy were compared in an occupational cohort study . parental bpa exposure level during the index pregnancy was estimated through a job - exposure matrix based on personal air sampling measurement . maternal exposure was considered direct in utero exposure to the fetus , whereas paternal exposure was considered indirect in utero exposure . results : a total of 153 boys were included in the final analysis , among them 56 with parental occupational exposure during pregnancy and 97 without . after controlling for the boys ' ages and weights using linear regression , parental occupational exposure to bpa during pregnancy was associated with shortened agd in male offspring . the association was stronger for maternal exposure ( p < 0 . 01 ). there was also a dose - response relationship with increased bpa exposure levels in pregnancy associated with greater magnitude of shortened agd in male offspring , with a statistically significant trend for the association ( p = 0 . 008 ). conclusion : our findings provide the first epidemiologic evidence that in utero bpa exposure may adversely affect male genital development .	0
preliminary study of responses in mussel ( mytilus edilus ) exposed to bisphenol a , diallyl phthalate and tetrabromodiphenyl ether .. environmental pollutants with hormonal activity including bisphenol , diallyl phtalate and tetrabromodiphenyl ether , have the potential to alter gonadal development and reproduction in aquatic wildlife . little is known about the biological impact of environmentally relevant concentrations in mussels . to investigate some aspects of their potential estrogenic action , mussels were continuously exposed during 3 weeks . gonadal development and vitellogenin like protein levels were examined . bisphenol ( 50 microg / l ) induced the expression of phospho - proteins in females and spawning in both sexes . diallyl phthalate and tetrabromodiphenyl ether decreased phospho - protein levels in both sexes and induced spawning in males . moreover , severe damaging effects on ovarian follicles and ovocytes were observed in both bisphenol a - and tetrabromodiphenyl ether - exposed female mussels .	0
effects of seawater pollutants on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in mussel tissues .. different exogenous compounds are known to stimulate tyrosine kinase signaling , and this could explain a wide spectrum of pollutant effects on different organisms . we studied the effects of various seawater contaminants on tyrosine phosphorylation levels in different tissues of the mussel ( mytilus edulis ), by using western immunoblotting . mussels were exposed in aquarium for 3 weeks to north sea oil alone or to a mixture of north sea oil , alkyl phenols , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ). in another experiment , mussels were exposed for 3 weeks to each of the following potential endocrine disruptors : bisphenol a , diallyl phthalate , or tetrabromodiphenylether - 47 . in a third experiment , mussels were caged at four sites along a copper field gradient . use of antiphosphotyrosine antibody showed that treatments with oil alone , or with oil , alkyl phenols and pah induced phosphorylation increases in the digestive gland , gills and mantle . bisphenol a produced significant effects in the gills and mantle , while diallyl phthalate and tetrabromodiphenylether - 47 had a slight effect only on the gill tissue . mussels exposed to the copper field gradient showed phosphotyrosine increases in the gills and mantle at intermediate levels of contamination . this latter result was also confirmed by using phosphospecific p38 antibody . in summary , the strength of induction was : oil mixture > oil > bisphenol a > or = copper ; while the degree of tissue responsiveness was : mantle > gill > digestive gland . based on these data , the use of tyrosine phosphorylation levels as a biomarker of seawater pollution is proposed .	0
sealing occlusal caries lesions in adults referred for restorative treatment : 2 - 3 years of follow - up .. the aim of this study was to assess the possibility to arrest occlusal caries lesions in adults by sealant as well as to assess the presence of radiographic progression , arrest , and regression of the sealed lesions . seventy - two occlusal caries lesions in 52 adult patients referred to restorative treatment by senior lecturers at school of dentistry , copenhagen , denmark were included . in case the patient had more than one occlusal caries lesion , randomization between sealing and restoration was made ; otherwise , the lesion was sealed . in total , 60 resin sealants and 12 composite restorations were made . follow - up period was 25 - 38 months ( mean = 33 months ). data were analyzed using non - parametric statistics including kappa statistics . after 2 - 3 years , the dropout rate was 15 %; two patients did not show up for control and nine previously sealed lesions were restored by the patients ' general practitioners . all 12 restorations and 39 of the remaining 49 sealants were well functioning , seven ( 14 %) sealants were repaired / replaced due to failure , and three ( 6 %) sealed lesions were restored due to caries progression ( p > 0 . 05 ). the radiographic assessment showed caries progression beneath five ( 10 %) sealants , caries regression beneath one ( 2 %) sealant , and unchanged depth beneath 43 ( 88 %) sealants and all restorations ( p > 0 . 05 ). the majority of the referred lesions were successfully arrested by sealants , indicating the possibility for extending the criteria for sealing occlusal caries lesions in adults . however , a longer observation period is needed for final conclusion . extending the criteria of therapeutic sealing of occlusal caries lesions in adults will lead to increased dental health .	0
preparation and characterization of cyclopolymerizable resin formulations .. an amine - catalyzed reaction between acrylates and formaldehyde has been used to convert mono - acrylates to difunctional monomers and di - acrylates to multifunctional oligomers by linking the acrylic double bonds together in 1 , 6 - diene pairs . the resulting monomers and oligomers undergo efficient cyclopolymerization to high conversion with significantly less shrinkage than normally found for acrylates . in this study , a convenient single - step process was used with mixtures of mono - and di - acrylate starting materials to produce a series of resins with potential for effective cyclopolymerization . incremental changes in the ethyl acrylate ( ea ) to ethoxylated bisphenol a diacrylate ( ebpad ) ratio directly supplied cyclopolymerizable resins with a broad range of viscosities and product distributions . those resins produced from reaction mixtures rich in ea have low viscosities because of high diluent monomer contents and limited oligomerization of ebpad due to end - cap formation . resin viscosity and average molecular weight of the oligomeric component of the resin were inversely related to the amount of ea used in the reaction . through the choice of reactants and their ratio , this simple technique has the potential to provide cyclopolymerizable resins for use in a variety of dental polymer applications .	0
[ sensitizing capacity , cross - reactivity and antigenic determinants of bisphenol a ].. bis - gma and epoxy resins are known to cause allergic reactions in some patients . the purpose of this research was to investigate the sensitizing capacity , cross - reactivity and antigenic determinants of bisphenol a ( bpa ), a major constituent of bis - gma and bpa type epoxy resins . anti - bpa antibodies were prepared from mice injected with bpa - ovalbumin conjugates ( bpa - ova ), and the reactions of the structurally bpa - related compounds were compared with that of bpa using these antibodies by the enzyme immunoassay ( eia ) and eia inhibition test . the findings are as follows : 1 ) injection of bpa failed to generate anti - bpa antibodies . however , injection of bpa - ova was effective in producing antibodies strongly reacting with bpa . 2 ) polyclonal anti - bpa antibodies cross - reacted with bisphenol b ( bpb ), p - isopropyl - phenol ( ipp ), diethylstilbestrol ( des ) and 2 , 4 - dinitrophenyl ( dnp ). 3 ) five kinds of monoclonal anti - bpa antibodies were obtained . these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with bpa and moderately cross - reacted with ipp , des and bpb , but not with dnp . the results suggest that bpa - ova is capable of eliciting anti - bpa antibody production in mice and that the antigenic determinant of bpa is the structure of one central carbon atom , covalently bound with two phenyl groups and two methyl groups .	0
preparation of microspheres and microcapsules by interfacial polycondensation techniques .. a methodological review of the production of microspheres / microcapsules by interfacial polycondensation is presented and the mechanisms of particle and capsule formation are discussed . procedures for interfacial polycondensation employed for the preparation of microspheres / microcapsules involve the polycondensation of two complementary monomers in a two phase suspension system . each of the two complementary monomers resides largely in one of the two immiscible phases in the suspension system . the resulting polycondensate , which is formed at or on one side of the interface , may , or may not , be soluble in the droplet phase . if the polymer is soluble in the droplets , particulate microspheres or monolithic microcapsules are formed , i . e . particle forming interfacial polycondensation . if the polymer is insoluble in the droplets , it forms a membrane around them , and the droplets are thus individually encapsulated by the polymer . this leads to the formation of capsular microspheres or reservoir microcapsules , and hence capsule forming interfacial polycondensation . a major example of particle forming interfacial polycondensation is that of phosgene with bisphenol a recently developed for the production of polycarbonate resins in particle form . capsule forming interfacial polycondensation is widely used to prepare polyamide ( nylon ) microcapsules containing proteins , pharmaceuticals , etc .	0

neuroprotective effects of arachidonic acid against oxidative stress on rat hippocampal slices .. arachidonic acid ( aa ), 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 - eicosateraenoic acid is abundant , active and necessary in the human body . in the present study , we reported the neuroprotective effects and mechanism of arachidonic acid on hippocampal slices insulted by glutamate , nan ( 3 ) or h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) in vitro . different types of models of brain injury in vitro were developed by 1mm glutamate , 10mm nan ( 3 ) or 2mm h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ). after 30 min of preincubation with arachidonic acid or linoleic acid , hippocampal slices were subjected to glutamate , nan ( 3 ) or h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ), then the tissue activities were evaluated by using the 2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride method . endogenous antioxidant enzymes activities ( sod , gsh - px and catalase ) in hippocampal slices were evaluated during the course of incubation . mk886 ( 5 microm ; a noncompetitive inhibitor of proliferator - activated receptor [ ppar ] alpha ), badge ( bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ; 100 microm ; an antagonist of ppargamma ) and cycloheximide ( chx ; 30 microm ; an inhibitor of protein synthesis ) were tested for their effects on the neuroprotection afforded by arachidonic acid . population spikes were recorded in randomly selected hippocapal slices . arachidonic acid ( 1 - 10 microm ) dose dependently protected hippocampal slices from glutamate and h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) injury ( p < 0 . 01 ), and arachidonic acid ( 10 microm ) can significantly improve the activities of cu / zn - sod in hippocampal slices after 1h incubation . in addition , 10 microm arachidonic acid significantly increased the activity of mn - sod and catalase , and decreased the activities of cu / zn - sod to control value after 3h incubation . these secondary changes of sod during incubation can be reversed by indomethacine ( 10 microm ; a nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor ) or aa 861 ( 20 microm ; a 5 - lipoxygenase inhibitor ). its neuroprotective effect was completely abolished by badge and chx . these observations reveal that arachidonic acid can defense against oxidative stress by boosting the internal antioxidant system of hippocampal slices . its neuroprotective effect may be mainly mediated by the activation of ppargamma and synthesis of new protein in tissue .	0
lack of significant alteration in the prostate or testis of f344 rat offspring after transplacental and lactational exposure to bisphenol a .. bisphenol a ( bpa ), a compound of great concern as an estrogenic xenobiotic , was assessed for its ability to cause alteration in the accessory sex organs and spermatogenesis in male offspring exposed preneonatally and neonatally . in a series of experiments focusing on rat sensitivity to gestational and lactational exposure to bpa , we investigated its effects on gestation period and reproductive organs in male offspring . in the first instance , bpa was administered to f344 female rats by gavage at 0 , 7 . 5 , 120 mg / kg / day during pregnancy and lactation period . there were no observable adverse effects in pregnant rats and the treatment did not induce any morphological abnormalities in the accessory sex organs of male offspring . however , lowered numbers of sperm in the testis were found with a dose of 120 mg / kg / day . in the second study , the same protocol with a higher number of male offspring was applied , but no reduction in the sperm count was apparent . we conclude that transplacental and lactational exposure to bpa dose not exert any adverse effects on morphogenesis of rat accessory sex organs or spermatogenesis .	0
characterization and in vitro estrogenicity of orthodontic adhesive particulates produced by simulated debonding .. objective : to investigate the structure and composition of ground orthodontic adhesive particulates produced under simulated clinical conditions and assess their estrogenic action in vitro . materials and methods : a chemically cured and a light - cured adhesive were included in the study . specimens were prepared by simulating bonding procedures , covering the bracket base surface with cellulose films to detach the full set material . the adhesives prepared under this method were grounded in glass chambers with an 8 - fluted tungsten carbide on a high - speed handpiece ; a new bur and different chamber was used for each adhesive sample and grindings were performed on different days to avoid contamination of the room . the adhesive particulates produced were subjected to ft - ir spectroscopy for the molecular characterization of particles ; scanning electron microscopy for the morphologic condition and structure ; and x - ray microanalysis for the elemental composition of the particles . amounts of the ground adhesives were immersed in saline for 1 month at 37 degrees c . eluents from solution of the two adhesives were added to media of an estrogen - responsive cell line derived from human breast adenocarcinoma ( mcf - 7 ), to assess the estrogenicity . positive ( estradiol and bisphenol - a ) and negative ( saline ) controls were used ; all assays were repeated four times and the results were averaged . estrogenicity data were analyzed with one - way anova and the tukey test at the . 05 level of significance . results : the study of the composition of particles revealed compounds related to monomers with no major differences noted . significant structural alterations were observed between the materials studied , with the chemically cured adhesive having larger particles . the ground samples contained si , na and al apparently deriving from fillers , whereas large ba fillers were identified only in the chemically cured group , whereas no distinct molecular variation was noted between the set material and its corresponding particulate form . both chemically cured and light - cured adhesives exhibited an estrogenic action through induction of the proliferation rate of mcf - 7 cells ( 160 % and 128 %, respectively , compared to control ). significance : apart from the potentially hazardous action of adhesive particulate aerosol produced by grinding , composite resin particulates may act as endocrinological disruptors .	0

prosthetic replacement of the hip in dogs using bioactive bone cement .. total hip arthroplasties were performed in dogs using bioactive bone cement consisting of silane treated cao - mgo - sio2 - p2o5 - caf2 glass powder as the filling particles and bisphenol - a - glycidyl methacrylate based resin as the organic matrix , and the outcomes were compared with the results of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement . the mechanical properties of the bioactive bone cement were stronger than the mechanical properties of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement . the bonding strength of the bioactive bone cement to bone in dogs ' femora increased with time , reaching 4 . 7 mpa at 6 months , whereas that of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement did not increase , remaining at 1 . 0 mpa . results of histologic examination showed direct bonding between the bioactive bone cement and bone , and the bony trabeculae around the cement mantle grew with time . however , in polymethylmethacrylate bone cement , an intervening soft tissue layer was evident at the bone cement interface . direct bonding of the bioactive bone cement at the interface through an apatite layer of 30 microm in thickness was shown through observation with the scanning electron microscopy . using this bioactive bone cement in clinical settings may help alleviate serious problems associated with cemented total hip arthroplasty , such as aseptic loosening of the implant and mechanical failure of the bone cement .	0
marginal quality and microleakage of adhesive class v restorations .. objectives : the aim of this in vitro study was to determine the marginal quality and microleakage of composite resin class v restorations . methods : standardized mixed class v cavities ( diameter : 4mm , depth : 2mm ) with half of the finish lines limited within dentin were cut in 90 freshly extracted human molars and randomly assigned to nine groups ( n = 10 ). after etching enamel and dentin , the cavities were restored with nine different restorative systems ( syntac sprint / tetric ceram = ss , syntac single - component / tetric ceram = sc , onestep / aeliteflo = os , aquaprep + onestep / aeliteflo = oa , prime & bond 2 . 1 / tph = pb , optibond solo / prodigy = op , singlebond / z100 = sb , tenure quik / marathon = tq , solobond m / arabesk = sm ) using a wet - bonding procedure . after finishing and polishing , the teeth were stored for 24h in distilled water at 37 degrees c before they were subjected to thermocycling ( 5 / 55 degrees c , 1000x ). epoxy replicas were made for margin analysis in the sem . specimens were stained in methylene blue , sectioned , and evaluated for microleakage . dye penetration was scored on a 0 - 3 ordinal scale . results : statistical analysis ( kruskal - wallis h - test , mann - whitney u - test ) revealed significant differences ( p < 0 . 05 ) among the groups at dentin and enamel margins for the microleakage scores as well as for the results of the quantitative sem margin analysis . sc revealed a significantly higher percentage of perfect margins in the sem than os and sm in enamel and dentin , respectively . oa exhibited significantly more leakage in enamel than all other groups . conclusions : none of the tested restorative systems achieved a perfect seal in dentin and enamel of mixed class v cavities . marginal quality and sealing ability of adhesive systems to dentin , using a wet - bonding procedure , is still inferior compared with enamel margins .	0
fine spatial assembly for construction of the phenol - binding pocket to capture bisphenol a in the human nuclear receptor estrogen - related receptor γ .. various lines of evidence have shown that bisphenol a ( bpa ) acts as an endocrine disruptor that affects various hormones even at merely physiological levels . we demonstrated recently that bpa binds strongly to human nuclear receptor estrogen - related receptor γ ( errγ ), one of 48 nuclear receptors . based on x - ray crystal analysis of the errγ ligand - binding domain ( lbd )/ bpa complex , we demonstrated that errγ receptor residues , glu275 and arg316 , function as the intrinsic - binding site of the phenol - hydroxyl group of bpa . if these phenol - hydroxyl ↔ glu275 and arg316 hydrogen bonds anchor the a - benzene ring of bpa , the benzene - phenyl group of bpa would be in a pocket constructed by specific amino acid side chain structures . in the present study , by evaluating the ala - replaced mutant receptors , we identified such a ligand - binding pocket . leu268 , leu271 , leu309 and tyr326 , in addition to the previously reported participants glu275 and arg316 , were found to make a receptacle pocket for the a - ring , whereas ile279 , ile310 and val313 were found to assist or structurally support these residues . the results revealed that each amino acid residue is an essential structural element for the strong binding of bpa to errγ .	0
influence of nd : yag laser irradiation on microtensile bond strength of adhesive systems to sound or carious dentin .. objective : to evaluate the microtensile bond strength of 2 adhesive systems ( adper single bond plus [ 3m espe ] and clearfil se bond [ kuraray ]) to carious or normal dentin , with or without previous treatment with nd : yag laser or nd : yag laser associated with fluoride . method and materials : dentin surfaces of 60 human third molars were exposed . teeth were divided into 12 groups ; groups 1 to 6 were submitted to ph cycling for artificial caries , and groups 7 to 12 remained with normal dentin . dentin surfaces received 3 treatments : laser nd : yag irradiation ( 60 mj , 15 hz , and 0 . 9 w ) for 1 minute ; laser nd : yag irradiation associated with fluoride in gel ; and no treatment ( controls ). in experimental groups , adhesive systems were applied in accordance with the manufacturers ' instructions , and a composite resin block ( filtek z250 , 3m espe ) was made incrementally for the microtensile bond strength test . the teeth were sectioned serially in both x and y directions , and sticks were submitted to microtensile bond strength testing in a universal testing machine . results : according to anova and tukey ( p < . 05 ), the highest mean bond strengths were obtained in groups of normal dentin treated with clearfil se bond ( 40 . 65 mpa ) and single bond ( 34 . 2 mpa ). the presence of carious dentin significantly decreased the mean bond strengths of the 2 adhesive systems whether or not they were previously laser irradiated . nevertheless , clearfil se bond presented the best microtensile bond strength on an irradiated surface . moreover , laser irradiation associated with fluoride also decreased the bond strength values of the 2 adhesive systems . conclusion : after excavating a cavity with caries - affected dentin , the use of nd : yag laser followed by a self - etching adhesive system is the best clinical choice when considering bond strength , compared with the total etching - based system and laser .	0
a synthetic antagonist for the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma inhibits adipocyte differentiation .. while searching for natural ligands for the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( ppar ) gamma , we identified a synthetic compound that binds to this receptor . bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) is a ligand for ppargamma with a k ( d ( app )) of 100 microm . this compound has no apparent ability to activate the transcriptional activity of ppargamma ; however , badge can antagonize the ability of agonist ligands such as rosiglitazone to activate the transcriptional and adipogenic action of this receptor . badge also specifically blocks the ability of natural adipogenic cell lines such as 3t3 - l1 and 3t3 - f442a cells to undergo hormone - mediated cell differentiation . these results provide the first pharmacological evidence that ppargamma activity is required for the hormonally induced differentiation of adipogenic cells .	0
statistical results on restorative dentistry experiments : effect of the interaction between main variables .. unlabelled : statistical analysis interpretation is a critical field in scientific research . when there is more than one main variable being studied in a research , the effect of the interaction between those variables is fundamental on experiments discussion . however , some doubts can occur when the p - value of the interaction is greater than the significance level . objective : to determine the most adequate interpretation for factorial experiments with p - values of the interaction nearly higher than the significance level . materials and methods : the p - values of the interactions found in two restorative dentistry experiments ( 0 . 053 and 0 . 068 ) were interpreted in two distinct ways : considering the interaction as not significant and as significant . results : different findings were observed between the two analyses , and studies results became more coherent when the significant interaction was used . conclusion : the p - value of the interaction between main variables must be analyzed with caution because it can change the outcomes of research studies . researchers are strongly advised to interpret carefully the results of their statistical analysis in order to discuss the findings of their experiments properly .	0
simple and rapid analysis of endocrine disruptors in liquid medicines and intravenous injection solutions by automated in - tube solid - phase microextraction / high performance liquid chromatography .. a simple and rapid method was developed for analyzing contamination of endocrine disruptors in liquid medicines and intravenous injection solutions . endocrine disrupting compounds such as bisphenol a ( bpa ), alkylphenols and phthalates were quantitated by on - line in - tube solid - phase microextraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography ( in - tube spme / hplc ) with uv detection . the liquid medicines and intravenous injection solutions could be used directly without any pretreatment , and the bpa , alkylphenols and phthalates in these solutions were automatically analyzed . the limits of quantification for these compounds were 1 - 10 ng / ml . recoveries of these compounds spiked to the intravenous injection solutions was over 80 %, except for some phthalates . di - n - butyl phthalate ( dbp ) was detected at a concentration of 7 - 60 ng / ml in most intravenous injection solutions in plastic containers , but it was not detected in solutions in glass bottles . diethyl phthalate , di - n - propyl phthalate , dbp and di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ( dehp ) were also detected in syrup , lotion and eye drops in plastic containers . on the other hand , bpa and alkylphenols were not detected at all in these solutions . dehp contamination from an administration set increased when total vitamin formulation was added to the infusion solution . dehp was easily leached from polyvinyl chloride tubing by polysorbate 80 . the in - tube spme / hplc method is simple , rapid and automatic , and it provides a useful tool for the screening and determination of endocrine disruptor contamination in liquid medicines and intravenous injection solutions .	0
preparation , morphological characterization , and activity of thin films of horseradish peroxidase .. active uniform films of horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) have been prepared by covalent binding on si / sio ( 2 ) or glass supports previously activated by silanization and succinylation . labeling by fluorescent or by electron spin resonance ( esr ) probes was used to quantify the surface density of active groups and of horseradish peroxidase . atomic force microscopy ( afm ) imaging was used to characterize the surface morphology . we observed that a non - uniform protein adsorption due to physical interactions was present when the supports were not activated for covalent binding and was , in large part , removed by washing . the enzyme deposited by covalent binding formed homogeneous layers with a height in the range 60 - 90 a . by using a fluorescent label , we calculated a protein density of 3 . 6 x 10 ( 12 ) molecules cm (- 2 ) on si / sio ( 2 ), corresponding to an estimated area per molecule of 2800 a ( 2 ) which is in agreement with the value expected on the basis of the crystallographic data considering the formation of a monomolecular layer . the protein density of the layer immobilized on glass was similar ( 1 . 9 x10 ( 12 ) molecules cm (- 2 )). the enzyme immobilized on both supports showed a k ( cat )/ k ( m ) being of the order of 3 - 5x10 ( 5 ) m (- 1 ) s (- 1 ) that is 1 / 20th of free hrp . the half - life time of the activity of the enzyme immobilized by covalent binding was longer than 40 days at 6 degrees c .	0
"""oxygen inhibition and incremental layer bond strengths of resin composites .. objectives : when dentists light cure resin composite restorations in increments or after contouring the surface layer to shape with a hand instrument the surface layer is exposed to air during polymerization . the presence of an oxygen inhibited resin surface layer may impact on clinical performance . conflicting data has been produced in vitro regarding this topic . methods : to shed further light on this subject the current investigation assessed the thickness of the oxygen inhibited layer ( oil ) and subsequent interfacial bond strength at various times post - cure of an """" initial increment """" for a range of experimental and commercial resin composites . the latter included conventional methacrylate - based composites and a novel low shrink silorane resin chemistry product . results : a decrease in composite viscosity brought about by an increase in diluent monomer content in the matrix for the experimental composite formulations led to increase in oil thickness . the oil surface layer thickness for the commercial methacrylate - based rbc specimens cured in air were 19 . 2 +/- 6 . 3 and 13 . 8 +/- 5 . 3 microm , respectively and 9 . 0 +/- 6 . 6 microm for silorane . no test material exhibited a measurable oil thickness polymerized in the nitrogen atmosphere . significance : from the current findings it may be concluded that incremental bond strength is not wholly reliant on surface inhibition since no differences in bond strength following immediate placement were observed between air and nitrogen atmosphere for any experimental or commercial material . for large restorations requiring multiple increments which are placed on fresh material , the bond strength between successive layers of silorane should be no different to conventional methacrylate materials . repair and bonding to aged silorane restorations may be more problematic as inferior incremental bond strengths ensued when addition was delayed ."""	0
polymerization shrinkage and contraction stress of dental resin composites .. objective : the aim of this study was to evaluate the shrinkage , contraction stress , tensile modulus , and the flow factor of 17 commercially available dental resin composites . method : the volumetric shrinkage measurements were performed by mercury dilatometry , and the contraction stress and tensile modulus were determined by means of stress - strain analysis . the statistical analysis was conducted by anova and tukey ' s post hoc test , and linear regression . results : strong linear correlation for most resin composites were found for ( i ) contraction stress and shrinkage ( ii ) contraction stress and tensile modulus , and ( iii ) shrinkage and tensile modules . for most of the materials the unpolymerized resin content determines the amount of shrinkage , contraction stress and tensile modules . the pre - polymerized clusters in heliomolar results in improved shrinkage / contraction stress properties . the shrinkage / contraction stress for filtek z100 , aelite flo , and flow - it was too high for the amount of resin in the resin composite . this was rationalized by high polymerization rates , a flow factor , and the nature of the resin . significance : high shrinkage and / or high contraction stress may lead to failure of the bond between the resin composites and the tooth structure . this study shows that the unpolymerized resin content determines the amount of shrinkage , contraction stress and tensile modules . therefore , using pre - polymerized clusters will improve shrinkage / contraction stress properties , as was shown in heliomolar , while high polymerization rates , and low flow factors have a deteriorative effect on the shrinkage / contraction stress properties .	0
effect of dentin desensitizers and dentin bonding agents on dentin permeability .. purpose : to determine the effect of dentin desensitizing agents ( oxalates and glutaraldehyde ) and dentin bonding agents , with and without resin - based composite ( rbc ) on dentin permeability and morphology of the dentin surface . the influence of saliva and toothbrushing on these agents was also evaluated . materials and methods : radicular dentin discs +/- 1 mm thick were obtained from extracted human teeth . the thickness of the discs was standardized by grinding them with 600 grit silicon carbide powder . both pulpal and periodontal surfaces of the discs were treated with 6 % citric acid for 2 min prior to the baseline measurement of dentin permeability . permeability was measured for the discs , using a split - chamber apparatus , at four different time points : at baseline , after treatment with each desensitizing modality , after 24 hrs of saliva immersion and after simulated toothbrushing equivalent to 3 weeks of normal brushing . the treatment modalities were : sensodyne dentin desensitizer , gluma dentin desensitizer , all - bond ds ( primers without etching ), etch + primers ( all - bond 2 system ), etch + primers + adhesive and etch + primers + adhesive + rbc ( aelite flo ). radicular dentin discs were prepared separately for scanning electron microscopy ( sem ). one group was left untreated as the control group . discs in the other groups were treated with the modalities listed above . one disc from each group was viewed under the sem after treatment with the desensitizing modality . the second disc in each group was viewed after 24 hrs of saliva immersion following desensitizing treatment and the third disc after 3 weeks of simulated toothbrushing following desensitizing treatment and saliva immersion . results : the greatest reduction in permeability was caused by all - bond ds followed by sensodyne dentin desensitizer and etch + primers + adhesive + rbc . gluma dentin desensitizer , etch + primers , and etch + primers + adhesive did not reduce permeability by a significant amount . saliva immersion increased permeability significantly only for the gluma and etch + primers + adhesive groups . there was a trend towards increase in permeability after toothbrushing ; however , this increase was not statistically significant for any group ( p > 0 . 05 ). thus , placement of primers without etching ( all - bond ds ) reduced permeability more than any other treatment modality . these data indicate that etching a sensitive dentin area may be appropriate only if rbc is to be placed in the area . exposure to saliva and toothbrushing countered the decrease in permeability caused by dedicated desensitizers and dentin bonding agents . the sem micrographs revealed that in most cases , form corroborated function and the morphology of the dentin surface corresponded to the dentin permeability values .	0
mitochondrial signaling pathway is also involved in bisphenol a induced germ cell apoptosis in testes .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a potential endocrine disruptor and testicular toxicant . an earlier study showed that bpa - induced germ cell apoptosis through the fas / fasl apoptotic pathway . in the present study , we aimed to investigate whether the mitochondrial pathway is also involved in the process of bpa - mediated germ cell apoptosis in testes . male mice were administered with bpa ( 160 or 480 mg / kg ) by gavage daily from postnatal day 35 ( pnd35 ) to pnd49 . germ cell apoptosis in testes was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( tdt )- mediated dutp nick - end labeling ( tunel ). as expected , the number of tunel + germ cells per tubule and the percentage of tubules with tunel + germ cells were significantly increased in testes of mice treated with bpa during puberty . tunel + germ cells were observed mainly in stages vii - viii seminiferous tubules in testes . an increase in the level of fas and fasl was observed in testes of mice exposed to bpa during puberty . in addition , pubertal bpa exposure evoked the activation of caspase - 8 and caspase - 3 in testes . interestingly , pubertal bpa exposure also caused the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol . in addition , pubertal bpa exposure upregulated the level of bax and active caspase - 9 in testes . taken together , these results suggest that pubertal bpa exposure induces germ cell apoptosis in testes through not only the fas / fasl signaling pathway but also the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway .	0

shear bond strength of a self - etching adhesive in primary and permanent dentition .. purpose : to assess the shear bond strength obtained with a new self - etching adhesive material ( adper prompt - l - pop ) compared with the total - etch technique and posterior application of an adhesive ( prime & bond nt ) in both primary and permanent teeth . methods : 28 human teeth were selected ( 14 primary and 14 permanent ). the vestibular and lingual surfaces were prepared in dentin , followed by application of the adhesive materials ( adper prompt - l - pop and prime & bond nt ), in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer . compomer and composite ( compoglass and tph spectrum ) were used as filler materials . the samples were thermocycled ( 150 cycles ), after which adhesion was assessed with an autograph ags machine . the type of fracture produced was evaluated using an olympus scz - ctv microscope . the data were compared by triple - factor analysis of variance , statistically significant differences being considered for p < 0 . 01 . results : the adhesion strength achieved with prime & bond nt involving both composite and compomer as restorative material was significantly greater than with prompt - l - pop . no differences were observed between the two dentitions .	0
effect of occlusal load cycling on the marginal integrity of adhesive class v restorations .. the objective of this study was to evaluate the gingival wall marginal integrity of adhesive class v restorations subjected to occlusal load cycling . extracted lower first and second molar teeth were used . for each tooth , a class v cavity was prepared in the buccal or lingual surface with the gingival margin in the cementum . the cavities were restored with eight different adhesive systems : ( 1 ) ketac - fil ; ( 2 ) fuji ii lc ; ( 3 ) ketac - bond / pertac ; ( 4 ) photac - bond / pertac ; ( 5 ) scotchbond 2 / p50 ; ( 6 ) scotchbond multi - purpose / p50 ; ( 7 ) clearfil liner bond / clearfil photo posterior ; and ( 8 ) optibond / herculite xr . for each material - combination , three test procedures were carried out : no loading ( control ), loading at 125 n and at 250 n . six specimens were prepared for each procedure . the samples were loaded for 5000 cycles in a dye solution and kept in the dye for 24 hours after loading . control samples were stored in the dye for the same period . all teeth were sectioned and dye penetration at the gingival wall was scored from 0 to 4 . under control condition , only groups 2 , 6 , 7 and 8 showed perfect marginal integrity . after loading at 125 n , groups 1 , 3 and 5 showed significant increase in leakage ( p < 0 . 05 ). increasing the load to 250 n resulted in significant deterioration in the marginal adaptation of all test groups , except 6 and 7 . this study indicates that the marginal integrity of occlusally stressed adhesive class v restorations can only be preserved by a few products .	0
consortium - based science : the niehs ' s multipronged , collaborative approach to assessing the health effects of bisphenol a .. background : bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a high production volume chemical used to make polycarbonate plastic and is found in many consumer products . some studies using animal models have suggested that bpa exposures may have adverse health effects . however , research gaps have precluded a full understanding of the effects of bpa in humans and engendered controversies surrounding the chemical ' s potential toxicity . objectives : the national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) and national toxicology program ( ntp ) have developed an integrated , multipronged , consortium - based approach to optimize bpa - focused research investments to more effectively address data gaps and inform decision making . discussion : niehs / ntp bpa research investments made over the past 4 years include extramural research grants , establishment of a bpa grantee consortium , intramural research activities on bpa ' s mechanisms of action , the launch of two clinical studies and an occupational study , development of a round - robin experiment to validate bpa measurements in human serum , and , in collaboration with the food and drug administration ( fda ), formation of a consortium to design and execute a chronic toxicity study of bpa in rats . the niehs ' s new consortium - based approach has led to more integrated , collaborative efforts and should improve our ability to resolve controversies over the potential human health effects of exposures to low levels of endocrine - active agents .	0
effects of thermocycling , load - cycling , and blood contamination on cemented implant abutments .. this study compared the effects of thermocycling , load - cycling , and human blood contamination on the retentive strength of five different cements for luting posts to root - form implants . for each cement , 10 specimens ( controls ) were stored in an incubator , 10 specimens were thermocycled , 10 specimens were subjected to cyclic compressive loading , 10 specimens were subjected to a combination of thermocycling and cyclic compressive loading , and 10 specimens were contaminated with blood before cementation , then exposed to a combination of thermocycling and compressive loading . after 70 hours , retentive tests were performed on the instron machine , and data were recorded in kilograms . significant retentive differences were identified among the cements and with load - cycling , but minimal effect on the retentive strength was demonstrated from thermocycling . blood contamination in combination with thermocycling and load - cycling adversely affected the retentive strengths of all of the cements and could be a major cause of abutment failure in dental implants .	0
a morphological and micro - tensile bond strength evaluation of a single - bottle adhesive to caries - affected human dentine after four different caries removal techniques .. objectives : this study evaluated the influence of different caries removal techniques ( conventional bur ; chemomechanical removal / carisolv ()- mediteam ; a sonic preparation system / sonicsysmicro - kavo and air abrasion / prepstar - danville engineering ) on microtensile bond strength to caries - affected human dentine . methods : occlusal surfaces of extracted human permanent third molars with coronal dentine caries extending approximately halfway through the dentine was ground perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth to expose a flat surface of normal dentine surrounding the carious lesion with laser fluorescence values of approximately 30 ( diagnodent ), kavo ). carious lesions were excavated with one of the four techniques until laser fluorescence values decreased to 15 in the center of the lesions . an ethanol - based dentine adhesive ( single bond , 3m ) was used to bond composite resin ( p60 , 3m ) to the substrate . vertical slices ( n = 11 / group ), approximately 0 . 8 mm thick were made through the caries - affected portions of each tooth , perpendicular to the bonding surface . specimens were subjected to tensile stress at a crosshead speed of 1 mm / min . data were analyzed by kruskal - wallis test . sem investigation was performed for the qualitative evaluation of resin - dentine hybridization . results : the microtensile bond strengths were as follows ( mean +/- sd in mpa ): 6 . 4 +/- 5 . 3 ( bur ), 8 . 4 +/- 3 . 3 ( carisolv ), 8 . 5 +/- 5 . 9 ( sonicsys micro ), and 8 . 8 +/- 8 . 8 ( air abrasion ). statistical analysis did not show significant differences between any of the treatment modalities ( p = 0 . 160 ). tensile fracture was cohesive within caries - affected dentine in all specimens . conclusions : the four different caries removal techniques used within this study did not influence the bond strength of the tested dentine adhesive to caries - affected human dentine .	0
