development of single - stranded dna aptamers for specific bisphenol a detection .. the development of reagents with high affinity and specificity to small molecules is crucial for the high - throughput detection of chemical compounds , such as toxicants or pollutants . aptamers are short and single - stranded ( ss ) oligonucleotides able to recognize target molecules with high affinity . here , we report the selection of ssdna aptamers that bind to bisphenol a ( bpa ), an environmental hormone . using selex process , we isolated high affinity aptamers to bpa from a 10 ( 15 ) random library of 60 mer ssdnas . the selected aptamers bound specifically to bpa , but not to structurally similar molecules , such as bisphenol b with one methyl group difference , or 4 , 4 '- bisphenol with 2 methyl groups difference . using these aptamers , we developed an aptamer - based sol - gel biochip and detected bpa dissolved in water . this novel bpa aptamer - based detection can be further applied to the universal and high - specificity detection of small molecules .	0
treatment of landfill leachate by electrochemical oxidation and anaerobic process .. the removal performance of typical refractory organic compounds in landfill leachate was investigated during the electrochemical ( ec ) oxidation and anaerobic process combined treatment system in this paper . the results indicated that the treatment of landfill leachate by the combined system was highly effective . the toxicity of leachate was notably decreased after the electrochemical oxidation process and the biodegradability was improved . the concentration of the organic acid with low molecular weight in the leachate increased from 28 % to 90 % based on the biodegradability assays after the ec oxidation process . the anaerobic digestion could further remove the residual organic compounds . at a hydraulic retention time ( hrt ) of 16 hours and an organic loading rate ( olr ) of 8 kg cod / m3 d , the concentration of cod , ss , alk , va , n - tkn , n - nh4 + and p - po4 ( 3 )- [ corrected ] in uasb effluent were 532 , 12 , 6744 , 400 , 540 , 455 and 11 . 6 mg / l , respectively , with approximately 90 % removal efficiency of cod . the organic compounds in the landfill leachate revealed different degradation characteristics in the combined system . p - chloroaniline , bisphenol a , 6 - methyl - 2 - phenyl - quinoline , dimethylnaphthaline and n '-( 2 - methyl - 4 - chlorophenyl )- n - cyclohexyformamidine , classified into the first group in this paper , were completely removed by the ec oxidation and did not reappear in the effluent of the uasb reactor . phenylacetic acid , 3 - methyl - indole and n - cyclohexyl - acetamide , called the second group , were completely removed , but reappeared in the uasb reactor . 4 - methyl - phenol , 3 , 4 - dihydroisoquinoline , 2 ( 3h )- benzothiazolone , exo - 2 - hydroxycineole and benzothiazole , the third group , were degraded little in the ec oxidation process , but extensively removed by the anaerobic process . benzoic acid , benzenepropanoic acid and 2 - cyano - 3 , 5 - dimethyl - 1 - hydroxypyrrole , the fourth group , concentration obviously increased in the ec process , but was completely removed in the uasb reactor . the content of volatile fatty acids ( vfas ) markedly increased from 0 . 68 % in the leachate to 16 . 18 % in the effluent from the electrochemical oxidation process ( ec ( effl )). in addition , the degradation rate of organic compounds from the landfill leachate was different in the ec oxidation and anaerobic process .	0
in situ tooth replica custom implant : rationale , material , and technique .. this study introduced a new concept of an in situ , custom - made , tooth replica dental implant . it was obtained by injecting a self - set , nonresorbable polymer type bone graft substitute into the tooth socket after extraction . based on its cited properties , new composite bone cement cortoss was suggested . the properties were reviewed and evaluated . the technique of application was described with a simulation model presented that appeared simple . apparently , immediate duplication of tooth anatomy was achieved ; thus , the concept might have the potentials of spontaneous adaptation and stabilization , preservation of alveolar bone , increasing implant - bone surface area , better load distribution , and bone stimulation . modifications were also described to manage cases of resorbed alveolar bone as well as long - standing extracted teeth . investigations were still required to assess the performance of the material and if modifications would be needed .	0
developmental reprogramming of reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in sheep : native steroids vs . environmental steroid receptor modulators .. the inappropriate programming of developing organ systems by exposure to excess native or environmental steroids , particularly the contamination of our environment and our food sources with synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals that can interact with steroid receptors , is a major concern . studies with native steroids have found that in utero exposure of sheep to excess testosterone , an oestrogen precursor , results in low birth weight offspring and leads to an array of adult reproductive / metabolic deficits manifested as cycle defects , functional hyperandrogenism , neuroendocrine / ovarian defects , insulin resistance and hypertension . furthermore , the severity of reproductive dysfunction is amplified by excess postnatal weight gain . the constellation of adult reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in prenatal testosterone - treated sheep is similar to features seen in women with polycystic ovary syndrome . prenatal dihydrotestosterone treatment failed to result in similar phenotype suggesting that many effects of prenatal testosterone excess are likely facilitated via aromatization to oestradiol . similarly , exposure to environmental steroid imposters such as bisphenol a ( bpa ) and methoxychlor ( mxc ) from days 30 to 90 of gestation had long - term but differential effects . exposure of sheep to bpa , which resulted in maternal levels of 30 - 50 ng / ml bpa , culminated in low birth weight offspring . these female offspring were hypergonadotropic during early postnatal life and characterized by severely dampened preovulatory lh surges . prenatal mxc - treated females had normal birth weight and manifested delayed but normal amplitude lh surges . importantly , the effects of bpa were evident at levels , which approximated twice the highest levels found in human maternal circulation of industrialized nations . these findings provide evidence in support of developmental origin of adult reproductive and metabolic diseases and highlight the risk posed by exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals .	1
transfer of maternally injected endocrine disruptors through breast milk during lactation induces neonatal calbindin - d9k in the rat model .. the uterus is a highly estrogen - responsive tissue , which can be measured through changes in cabp - 9k expression . in this study , we investigated the potential for estrogenic compounds 4 - tert - octylphenol ( op ), nonylphenol ( np ), bisphenol a ( bpa ), diethylstilbestrol ( des ) and 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) to be transferred through breast milk from dam to neonate during lactation using the induction of cabp - 9k in uterine tissue as a biomarker . dams were treated with op , np and bpa , dissolved in corn oil , at doses of 200 , 400 and 600 mg / kg body weight per day l for 5 days after delivery . dams and neonates were euthanized after 24h . treatment with these estrogenic compounds increased the expression of cabp - 9k mrna in the maternal uterus , in a dose - dependent manner . all doses of estrogenic compounds resulted in an increase in cabp - 9k protein levels . these compounds have an estrogenic effect on the maternal uterus during the lactation period as shown by the induction of both cabp - 9k mrna and protein . in the neonatal uterus , the expression of cabp - 9k mrna and protein significantly increased with des exposure . there was a significant increase in cabp - 9k mrna in neonatal uterus when the dams were treated with high doses of estrogenic compounds , but protein levels of cabp - 9k were undetectable . taken together , these findings suggest that maternally injected estrogenic compounds may be transferred to neonates through breast milk and thus affecting uterine function , as shown by the induction of cabp - 9k gene expression in the neonatal uterus .	0
effect of dentine on release of tegdma from resin composite in vitro .. triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ) is a component of some resin composites which contributes to their cytotoxicity . the presence of dentine between resin composite and test cells reduces the cytotoxicity in vitro . to determine why dentine has this protective effect , the diffusion of tegdma from a composite resin through dentine to the pulp space was compared with release directly into aqueous solution in vitro . both release rate and total cumulative release of tegdma for the two groups , at times up to 100 days , were determined using reversed - phase hplc . release rate directly into water was highest in the minutes immediately after immersion and declined thereafter . however , in the tooth model , using an equivalent mass and surface area of composite resin , no tegdma was detectable in the pulp space until 43 min after restoration placement . the rate of diffusion through dentine from that time until day 1 was less than 1 % of the highest ( initial ) direct release rate . the rate declined thereafter . it is relevant , however , that by day 3 the total cumulative release of tegdma through dentine was 60 % of the direct release . dentine therefore appears to exert its protective effect principally by retarding or ' damping ' the initial high release of tegdma to a substantial degree .	0
highly potent binding and inverse agonist activity of bisphenol a derivatives for retinoid - related orphan nuclear receptor rorγ .. the plastic chemical bisphenol a ( bpa ) has recently been suspected to be a base structure of endocrine disrupting chemicals , which achieve their adverse effects by interfering with human nuclear receptors . for instance , bpa , bisphenol af , and tetrabromo - or tetrachloro - bpa ( x₄ - bpa ) have been characterized as binders for errγ , er , and pparγ , respectively . this ongoing string of findings has led to apprehension that some other bpa derivatives might also perturb important human nuclear receptors . the retinoid - related orphan receptor rorγ has been strongly suspected to be a target of highly hydrophobic chemical substances because of its extreme affinity for lipophilic sterols . in the present study , we tested a series of bpa derivatives for their ability to bind to rorγ , and identified two distinctly potent derivatives having isopropyl or sec - butyl groups at positions adjacent to the bpa - 4 - hydroxyl group . in particular , di - sec - butyl - bpa has emerged as a considerably potent ligand ( ic₅₀ )= 146 nm ). in the reporter gene assay , these compounds suppressed the basal constitutive transcriptional activity originally induced by wild - type rorγ . the present results strongly suggested that rorγ , and perhaps also rorα and rorβ , binds highly hydrophobic and sterically hindered chemical substances , inducing some unspecified physiological and biochemical disruptions .	1

the effect of three polishing systems on the surface roughness of four hybrid composites : a profilometric and scanning electron microscopy study .. a highly polished composite restoration is necessary to help promote a plaque - free environment . in this study the polishability of four hybrid composites ( pertac , aph , herculite , and z100 ) was compared after finishing and polishing with the caulk enhance polishing kit , kerr composite finishing kit , and the espe mfs / mps polishing kit . profilometric evaluation revealed that the mfs / mps polishing system gave a superior polish for z100 , herculite , and pertac ; the enhance polishing system demonstrated the poorest polish with all four composites tested . there were no significant differences among the four composites when polished with each of the three polishing systems .	0
bond strength of a light - cured and two auto - cured glass ionomer liners .. ninety - nine extracted human molar teeth were used in this study comparing the shear bond strengths on dentine of one light - cured and two auto - cured polyalkenoate ( glass ionomer ) cements . bond strength can be influenced by differences in tooth structure . a balanced - incomplete block design ( hull and nie , 1981 ) was used to reduce variation attributable to such differences . cements were applied to paired dentine surfaces in combinations such that 66 tooth sides were treated with each material . a light - cured dentinal adhesive and composite resin restorative material were then placed and shear bond strength testing was conducted exactly 24 h after the completion of each specimen . mean forces ( mpa ) for the three materials were compared using an appropriate analysis of variance model ( balanced - incomplete - blocks ) the shear bond strengths ( mpa ) of the light - cured liner ( espe , seefeld / oberbay , frg ) was 4 . 71 +/- 1 . 16 . vitrabond showed the greatest variance of all three materials tested , however this material ' s average bond strength was greater than the maximum achieved for the other materials . student - newman - keuls comparison of means showed that all cements differed significantly from each other ( alpha = 0 . 05 ). it is concluded that the light - cured glass ionomer liner exhibited significantly better shear bond strength performance than the two auto - cured glass ionomers tested .	0
organic diagenesis in sediment and its impact on the adsorption of bisphenol a and nonylphenol onto marine sediment .. hydrophobic organic contaminants in marine water are mostly adsorbed onto ( partitioned into ) sediment organic matter ( som ). to study the impact of som diagenesis on sediment adsorption properties , artificial sediment with rich som content was incubated for more than 120 days . the sediment was sampled every week , and batch sediment adsorption tests were conducted with bisphenol a ( bpa ) and nonylphenol ( np ) as the model pollutants . the results show that the amount of organic matter loaded in the sediment decreased by nearly 80 % during incubation . for the incubated sediment , the bpa partition coefficient , kd , decreased whereas the organic normalized partition coefficient , koc , more than doubled . the experiments with np show an even greater increase in koc . organic matter diagenesis shows a profound effect on the adsorption behavior of sediment , as the som residue has an increasing affinity and partition capacity for organic contaminants .	0
"""shear bond strengths of one - bottle adhesives to oil - contaminated enamel .. purpose : to evaluate resin bond strength to enamel contaminated with handpiece oil . materials and methods : bovine teeth were randomly assigned to six groups of 20 teeth each for treatment with one of six different bonding systems ( five one - bottle and one multibottle ). for each system , 10 enamel specimens were contaminated with handpiece oil before acid - etching and 10 were contaminated after acid - etching . the enamel was etched for 15 seconds using 35 % phosphoric acid . following adhesive application , composite resin was bonded using a gelatin capsule technique . shear bond strengths from the two contaminated groups were compared to bond strengths to uncontaminated enamel obtained from a previous study that was performed by the same group of investigators , using the same facility , materials , and methods . results : two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) showed that the factor """" surface contamination """" did not have a significant effect on bond strength ( p > . 542 ). the type of adhesive and the interaction of adhesive and surface contamination were significant ( p < . 0001 and p < . 003 , respectively ). when oil was applied before etching , mean bond strengths ranged from 18 . 0 +/- 4 . 8 mpa for optibond solo ( kerr corp ., orange , california ) to 25 . 3 +/- 5 . 6 mpa for tenure quik with fluoride ( den - mat corp ., santa maria , california ). with oil applied after etching , bond strengths ranged from 18 . 4 +/- 8 . 0 mpa for tenure quik with fluoride to 27 . 4 +/- 5 . 4 mpa for single bond ( 3m dental products , st . paul , minnesota ). for the same adhesive , comparing uncontaminated and """" oil - before - etch """" contaminated groups , the only statistically significant difference in bond strengths was for optibond solo : 21 . 8 +/- 4 . 0 mpa ( uncontaminated ) versus 18 . 0 +/- 4 . 8 mpa ( oil before etch ). comparing uncontaminated and """" oil - after - etch """" groups , the only statistically significant difference was for tenure : 24 . 5 +/- 5 . 7 mpa ( uncontaminated ) and 18 . 4 +/- 8 . 0 mpa ( oil after etch )."""	0

antibacterial activity of different generation dentin - bonding systems .. objectives : the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of different generation dentin - bonding systems . method and materials : the antibacterial activities of dentin - bonding systems optibond fl primer , single bond , clearfil se bond primer , and prompt - l - pop were evaluated against streptococcus mutans , streptococcus salivarius , lactobacillus casei , and lactobacillus acidophilus . cervitec ( 1 % chlorhexidine varnish ) was also examined as a positive control material . disk diffusion tests with filter paper disks ( n = 10 ) containing a drop of each material ( 20 microl ) were used . after incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 hours , the growth inhibition zones were measured in millimeters . results : of all the materials tested , optibond fl primer , clearfil se bond primer , and prompt - lpop showed larger growth inhibition zones than the control material for all bacterial strains . no antibacterial effect was noted for single bond . the results indicated that optibond fl primer had the strongest effect against the s mutans and l casei , and clearfil se bond primer produced the largest inhibition zone for s salivarius and l acidophilus among the test materials . conclusion : the antibacterial effects observed for the tested different generation dentin - bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials .	0
effects of chemical cross - linkers on caries - affected dentin bonding .. the achievement of a strong and stable bond between composite resin and dentin remains a challenge in restorative dentistry . over the past two decades , dental materials have been substantially improved , with better handling and bonding characteristics . however , little attention has been paid to the contribution of collagen structure / stability to bond strength . we hypothesized that the induction of cross - linking in dentin collagen improves dentin collagen stability and bond strength . this study investigated the effects of glutaraldehyde - and grape seed extract - induced cross - linking on the dentin bond strengths of sound and caries - affected dentin , and on the stability of dentin collagen . our results demonstrated that the application of chemical cross - linking agents to etched dentin prior to bonding procedures significantly enhanced the dentin bond strengths of caries - affected and sound dentin . glutaraldehyde and grape seed extract significantly increased dentin collagen stability in sound and caries - affected dentin , likely via distinct mechanisms .	0
bisphenol a exposure disrupts genomic imprinting in the mouse .. exposure to endocrine disruptors is associated with developmental defects . one compound of concern , to which humans are widely exposed , is bisphenol a ( bpa ). in model organisms , bpa exposure is linked to metabolic disorders , infertility , cancer , and behavior anomalies . recently , bpa exposure has been linked to dna methylation changes , indicating that epigenetic mechanisms may be relevant . we investigated effects of exposure on genomic imprinting in the mouse as imprinted genes are regulated by differential dna methylation and aberrant imprinting disrupts fetal , placental , and postnatal development . through allele - specific and quantitative real - time pcr analysis , we demonstrated that maternal bpa exposure during late stages of oocyte development and early stages of embryonic development significantly disrupted imprinted gene expression in embryonic day ( e ) 9 . 5 and 12 . 5 embryos and placentas . the affected genes included snrpn , ube3a , igf2 , kcnq1ot1 , cdkn1c , and ascl2 ; mutations and aberrant regulation of these genes are associated with imprinting disorders in humans . furthermore , the majority of affected genes were expressed abnormally in the placenta . dna methylation studies showed that bpa exposure significantly altered the methylation levels of differentially methylated regions ( dmrs ) including the snrpn imprinting control region ( icr ) and igf2 dmr1 . moreover , exposure significantly reduced genome - wide methylation levels in the placenta , but not the embryo . histological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed that these epigenetic defects were associated with abnormal placental development . in contrast to this early exposure paradigm , exposure outside of the epigenetic reprogramming window did not cause significant imprinting perturbations . our data suggest that early exposure to common environmental compounds has the potential to disrupt fetal and postnatal health through epigenetic changes in the embryo and abnormal development of the placenta .	0
gene expression of ribosomal protein mrna in chironomus riparius : effects of endocrine disruptor chemicals and antibiotics .. ribosomal protein genes are essential for cellular development . to examine the effects of ribosomal protein genes under various cellular stress conditions in chironomids , ribosomal protein s3 ( rps3 ) and s6 ( rps6 ) cdna from chironomus riparius were characterized and their expression was analyzed during development . a comparative and phylogenetic study among different orders of insects was carried out by analysis of sequence databases . c . riparius rps3 was highly conserved at the protein level and shared over 85 % amino acid identity with homologous sequences from other insects . rps6 also showed approximately 80 % amino acid identity . the rps3 and s6 transcripts were present during different developmental stages but were most abundant during the embryonic stage . furthermore , expression of the previously reported ribosomal proteins rpl11 , l13 , and l15 , as well as rps3 and s6 was analyzed following exposure to various concentrations of three endocrine disruptor chemicals ( edcs ), di ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate , bisphenol a , and 4 - nonylphenol ( 4np ), and the veterinary antibiotics ( vas ) fenbendazole , sulfathiazole , and lincomycin . only rps3 gene expression was up - regulated significantly in response to edcs and fenbendazole . however , the c . riparius ribosomal proteins showed a limited response to cellular stress , following exposure to edcs and vas .	0
bisphenol a from dental polycarbonate crown upregulates the expression of htert .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is one of the endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) that possess estrogen - like biologic activity . many dental materials have been reported to release bpa . however , there are few reports available on the release of bpa from dental polycarbonates . the purpose of this study was to investigate the release of bpa from dental polycarbonate crowns and to evaluate the estrogenic activity of bpa . polycarbonate crowns were immersed in five solvents ( water , ethanol , n - hepthane , acetic acid , and acetonitrile ) at 37 or 65 degrees c for 24 h . the elution from the material was analyzed by high - performance liquid - chromatography ( hplc ) and mass - spectrometry ( ms ) analysis . bpa release was detected corresponding to the degradation of dental polycarbonates under the some storage conditions ( ethanol , acetic acid , and acetonitrile ). a previous report proved that estrogen increased human telomerase catalytic subunit ( htert ) mrna , whereas the effect of edcs on the htert promoter has never been reported . the estrogenic activity of bpa was analyzed by luciferase assay with the use of the htert promoter . this assay revealed that bpa was a positive regulator of htert transcription . in addition , quantitative real - time pcr analysis showed that bpa increased the expression level of htert mrna in mcf7 cells . herein , it is demonstrated that htert is a new target of bpa .	0

in vitro comparison of mechanical properties and degree of cure of a self - adhesive and four novel flowable composites .. purpose : to compare a self - adhesive with two low - shrinkage and two regular flowable resin - based composites ( rbcs ) in terms of degree of conversion ( dc ) as well as micromechanical ( indentation modulus [ e ]; vickers hardness [ hv ]) and macromechanical properties ( flexural strength [ σ ], modulus of elasticity [ eflexural ]). materials and methods : dc was investigated by an atr - ftir spectrometer at clinically relevant filling depths ( 0 . 1 mm , 2 mm , 4 mm , 6 mm bulk , 6 mm incremental ) and irradiation times ( 10 s , 20 s , 40 s ). micro - and macromechanical properties were measured with an automatic microhardness indenter and a three - point bending test device after curing the specimens for 20 s and storing them in distilled water for 24 h at 37 ° c . fillers were visualized using a field emission scanning electron microscope ( fe - sem ). results were evaluated using one - way anova , tukey ' s hsd post - hoc test , pearson ' s correlation and a multivariate analysis ( α = 0 . 05 ). a weibull analysis was used to assess σ . results : n ' durance dimer flow ( 65 . 66 %) reached the highest dc ( at 2 mm depth , 20 s irradiation ). in terms of macromechanical properties , ecusphere - flow ( 129 . 82 mpa ) for σ and synergy d6 flow ( 3 . 74 gpa ) for eflexural reached the highest values . the highest micromechanical properties were measured for the self - adhesive rbc ( vertise flow ; e = 10 . 81 gpa , hv = 60 . 20 n / mm2 ). reliability was highly influenced by filler weight ( η2 = 0 . 77 ) and volume ( η2 = 0 . 99 ) proportion . conclusion : in the present study , the self - adhesive rbc showed the highest reliability , highest dc ( together with one of the low - shrinkage rbcs ), and highest micromechanical properties as well as good macromechanical properties . moreover , a curing time of 40 s and an incremental thickness not exceeding 2 mm appeared to be necessary for such results .	0
effect of polyacrylic acid on the interface and bond strength of self - adhesive resin cements to dentin .. purpose : to examine the influence of 11 . 5 % polyacrylic acid pretreatment on the interface and bond strength of self - adhesive resin cements ( maxcem elite , relyx unicem , set ) to dentin . materials and methods : fifty - six third molars were randomly divided into seven groups : relyx arc as control ( arc ), relyx unicem ( rlxu ), maxcem elite ( mce ), set ( st ), polyacrylic acid + relyx unicem ( rlxu - p ), polyacrylic acid + maxcem elite ( mce - p ), and polyacrylic acid + set ( st - p ). resin composite blocks were luted to flat dentin . after storage in distilled water for 24 h , sticks with a cross - sectional area of ca 0 . 80 mm2 were obtained ( n = 24 per group ) and submitted to a microtensile bond strength ( µtbs ) test in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / min . two sets from each group were sectioned mesiodistally in the center of the crown and observed with a scanning electron microscope at 4000x magnification . results : the mean results of the µtbs test ( mpa ) followed by the same letter do not differ statistically significantly according to anova and tukey ' s post - hoc test ( p < 0 . 05 ): arc = 24 . 19 (± 6 . 90 ) a , rlxu - p = 23 . 12 (± 6 . 18 ) a , mce - p = 13 . 09 (± 5 . 87 ) b , rlxu = 10 . 23 (± 2 . 88 ) b , c , and mce = 8 . 14 (± 4 . 63 ) c . all set specimens failed during the cutting procedure . the hybrid layer was not observed for the self - adhesive resin cements , and resin tags were observed for relyx unicem and maxem elite when dentin was pretreated with polyacrylic acid . conclusion : pretreatment with 11 . 5 % polyacrylic acid was effective for bonding relyx unicem and maxcem elite to dentin .	0
dispersive liquid - liquid microextraction versus single - drop microextraction for the determination of several endocrine - disrupting phenols from seawaters .. two liquid - phase microextraction procedures : single - drop microextraction ( sdme ) and dispersive liquid - liquid microextraction ( dllme ), have been developed for the determination of several endocrine - disrupting phenols ( edps ) in seawaters , in combination with high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) with uv detection . the edps studied were bisphenol - a , 4 - cumylphenol , 4 - tertbutylphenol , 4 - octylphenol and 4 - n - nonylphenol . the optimized sdme method used 2 . 5 microl of decanol suspended at the tip of a micro - syringe immersed in 5 ml of seawater sample , and 60 min for the extraction time . the performance of the sdme is characterized for average relative recoveries of 102 +/- 11 %, precision values ( rsd )< 9 . 4 % ( spiked level of 50 ng ml (- 1 )), and detection limits between 4 and 9 ng ml (- 1 ). the optimized dllme method used 150 microl of a mixture acetonitrile : decanol ( ratio 15 . 7 , v / v ), which is quickly added to 5 ml of seawater sample , then subjected to vortex during 4 min and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for another 5 min . the performance of the dllme is characterized for average relative recoveries of 98 . 7 +/- 3 . 7 %, precision values ( rsd )< 7 . 2 % ( spiked level of 20 ng ml (- 1 )), and detection limits between 0 . 2 and 1 . 6 ng ml (- 1 ). the efficiencies of both methods have also been compared with spiked real seawater samples . the dllme method has shown to be a more efficient approach for the determination of edps in seawater matrices , presenting enrichment factors ranging from 123 to 275 , average relative recoveries of 110 +/- 11 %, and precision values ( rsd )< 14 %, when using a real seawaters ( spiked level of 3 . 5 ng ml (- 1 )).	0
two - body wear of dental composites under different loads .. purpose : although dental composites are excellent for restoring the appearance of natural tooth tissues , their relatively poor resistance to wear , especially in approximal and occlusal contact areas , is still a major source of concern . the aim of this research was to study a basic wear mechanism , under 2 - body wear conditions , that may be integrated into our understanding of the in vitro and in vivo wear behavior of dental composites . materials and methods : an in vitro 2 - body wear test was conducted on 2 selected ultrafine compact - filled dental composites under different magnitudes of sinusoidal cyclic load . the wear surfaces and cross sections of the wear layers were assessed using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) to explore the nature of the wear pattern of the dental composites under cyclic loading conditions . results : the wear losses of both composites increased with load . sem analysis of wear surfaces and subsurface sections indicated that the composites tested displayed different wear mechanisms from low to high loads . an explanation for the wear pattern is proposed based on the observed wear behavior . conclusion : the in vitro wear pattern of the ultrafine compact - filled dental composites tested is closely related to the applied load . although the wear loss increased in a roughly linear relationship with applied load , the underlying wear mechanism involved may experience a significant change from low to high load conditions during wear .	0

dietary exposure to chemical migrants from food contact materials : a probabilistic approach .. a two - dimensional probabilistic model has been developed to estimate the short - term dietary exposure of uk consumers to migrants from food packaging materials . the current eu approach uses a default scenario of assuming that all individuals are 60 kg weight and consume 1 kg of food packaged in the material of interest per day . using four uk national dietary and nutrition surveys comprising 4 - 7 day dietary records for different age groups and survey years , a sample representative of the uk population has been obtained consuming around 4200 different food items . each survey provides records for around 2000 individuals and supplies detailed information on the consumption of food and data on sex , height and socio - economic status which may be used to analyse the exposure of selected groups within the community . as a result we are able to address the variation in consumption of food amongst individuals , and account for actual body weights providing a more accurate representation of the ' true ' exposure . the migrants bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ), di - 2 - ethylhexyl adipate ( deha ) and styrene were considered as specimen compounds although the methodology employed has the flexibility to adapt to other migrants and packaging types and indeed other food contaminants . exposure for each individual is estimated by calculating and summing the individual exposure from each item in their diet , and is repeated for all individuals in each survey to produce a distribution of exposures for the population . the packaging type of each food item is assigned by utilizing known packaging types from the database or , by sampling from a distribution based upon market share information . the parameters contributing towards the exposure from a packaged dietary item are migrant concentration and item weight . distributions are used to represent the inherent variation and uncertainty affecting these parameters . where data on concentrations for a particular type of food are lacking , expert judgement is used to extrapolate from available data for other food types . the model can also be run using only migration data for food simulants . in this case , concentrations expected for each of the food items are assigned based on the data for the relevant food simulant . the primary outputs of the model are distributions of estimated daily intakes for the selected population . each distribution gives the variation across the population subject to the uncertain parameters sampled in that iteration of the model . analysing the ensemble of distributions allows us to obtain the confidence limits around estimates for percentiles due to the uncertainties . the probabilistic approach allows sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative importance of the input parameters and places confidence bounds on the outputs to show the effect of the uncertainties and the contribution of each food type toward the overall exposure .	0
softening patterns of post - cure heat - treated dental composites .. the softening of post - cure , heat - treated dental composites in various solutions was evaluated by knoop hardness measurements . the samples were heated at 120 degrees c for 7 min immediately after curing and immersed in various solutions , water , ethanol , heptane and 0 . 1 n naoh . significant increases in hardness were observed for heated samples when compared to unheated samples . the various solutions softened both heated and unheated composites but heated samples were softened to a lesser degree . plots of hardness of heated and unheated samples were nearly parallel , indicating that mechanisms such as penetration of the resin matrix , degradation of the silane coupling agent and fillers may be involved in the softening of both heated and unheated composites . post - cure heat treatment improved the resistance to softening of dental composites .	0
occupational exposure to bisphenol - a ( bpa ) and the risk of self - reported male sexual dysfunction .. background : animal studies have suggested that bisphenol - a ( bpa ) is a potential human endocrine disrupter ; but evidence from human studies is needed . methods : we conducted an occupational cohort study to examine the effect of occupational exposure to bpa on the risk of male sexual dysfunction . current workers from bpa - exposed and control factories were recruited . the exposed workers were exposed to very high bpa levels in their workplace . male sexual function was ascertained through in - person interviews using a standard male sexual function inventory . results : bpa - exposed workers had consistently higher risk of male sexual dysfunction across all domains of male sexual function than the unexposed workers . after controlling for matching variables and potential confounders , exposed workers had a significantly increased risk of reduced sexual desire [ odds ratios ( or ) = 3 . 9 , 95 % confidence interval : 1 . 8 - 8 . 6 ), erectile difficulty ( or = 4 . 5 , 95 % ci 2 . 1 - 9 . 8 ), ejaculation difficulty ( or = 7 . 1 , 95 % ci 2 . 9 - 17 . 6 ), and reduced satisfaction with sex life ( or = 3 . 9 , 95 % ci 2 . 3 - 6 . 6 ). a dose - response relationship was observed with an increasing level of cumulative bpa exposure associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction . furthermore , compared with the unexposed workers , bpa - exposed workers reported significantly higher frequencies of reduced sexual function within 1 year of employment in the bpa - exposed factories . conclusions : our findings provide the first evidence that exposure to bpa in the workplace could have an adverse effect on male sexual dysfunction .	0

disposition of a low dose of bisphenol a in male and female cynomolgus monkeys .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a weak estrogenic compound mass - produced with potential human exposure . following a single oral or intravenous ( iv ) dose of 100 microg / kg [ ring - 14c ( u )] radiolabeled bisphenol a ( 14c - bpa ) to male and female cynomolgus monkeys , 79 - 86 % of the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine over 7 days , and most of the urinary excretion was recovered by 24 h after dosing , a large part of this occurring within 12 h . the fecal excretion of radioactivity over 7 days was minimal ( 1 . 8 - 3 . 1 %). toxicokinetic parameters obtained from plasma 14c - bpa - derived radioactivity during 48 h were c ( max ) = 104 - 107 ng - eq / ml between 0 . 25 and 2 h , and auc ( oral ) = 244 - 265 ng - eq * h / ml after oral dosing . in the case of the iv dose , auc ( iv ) was 377 - 382 ng - eq * h / ml , and the bioavailability was 0 . 66 - 0 . 70 . the terminal elimination half - life was larger post - iv dose ( t ( 1 / 2iv ) = 13 . 5 - 14 . 7 h ) than post - oral dose ( t ( 1 / 2oral ) = 9 . 63 - 9 . 80 h ). after iv dose , the fast - phase half - life ( t ( 1 / 2f )) of total radioactivity was 0 . 61 - 0 . 67 h . the t ( 1 / 2f ) of unchanged 14c - bpa for females ( 0 . 39 h ) was smaller than that for males ( 0 . 57 h ). these results suggested the distribution of lipophilic 14c - bpa in adipose tissue after iv dose , in contrast to first pass metabolism after oral dose . 14c - bpa - derived radioactivity was strongly bound to plasma protein ( f ( p ) = 0 . 055 ). radio - hplc analysis suggested the predominant plasma and urinary metabolites were mono - and diglucuronide of 14c - bpa and unchanged 14c - bpa was very low (< or = 1 . 5 %) after oral dose . these results indicate that the intestinal absorption and metabolism of bpa was rapid and extensive , and the major metabolites , glucuronide conjugates of 14c - bpa , were rapidly excreted into urine in monkeys .	0
fate of nine recycled water trace organic contaminants and metal ( loid ) s during managed aquifer recharge into a anaerobic aquifer : column studies .. water quality changes associated with the passage of aerobic reverse osmosis ( ro ) treated recycled water through a deep anaerobic pyritic aquifer system was evaluated in sediment - filled laboratory columns as part of a managed aquifer recharge ( mar ) strategy . the fate of nine recycled water trace organic compounds along with potential negative water quality changes such as the release of metal ( loid ) s were investigated in large - scale columns over a period of 12 months . the anaerobic geochemical conditions provided a suitable environment for denitrification , and rapid ( half - life < 1 - 25 days ) degradation of the endocrine disrupting compounds ( bisphenol a , 17beta - estradiol , 17alpha - ethynylestradiol ), and iodipamide . however , pharmaceuticals ( carbamazepine and oxazepam ), disinfection by - products ( n - nitrosodimethylamine , n - nitrosomorpholine ) and iohexol did not degrade rapidly ( half - life > 100 days ). high retardation coefficients ( r ) determined for many of the trace organics ( r 13 to 67 ) would increase aquifer residence time and be beneficial for many of the slow degrading compounds . however , for the trace organics with low r values ( 1 . 1 - 2 . 6 ) and slow degradation rates ( half - life > 100 days ), such as n - nitrosodimethylamine , n - nitrosomorpholine and iohexol , substantial biodegradation during aquifer passage may not occur and additional investigations are required . only minor transient increases in some metal ( loid ) concentrations were observed , as a result of either pyrite oxidation , mineral dissolution or ph induced metal desorption , followed by metal re - sorption downgradient in the oxygen depleted zone .	0

developmental exposure to bisphenol a modulates innate but not adaptive immune responses to influenza a virus infection .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is used in numerous products , such as plastic bottles and food containers , from which it frequently leaches out and is consumed by humans . there is a growing public concern that bpa exposure may pose a significant threat to human health . moreover , due to the widespread and constant nature of bpa exposure , not only adults but fetuses and neonates are also exposed to bpa . there is mounting evidence that developmental exposures to chemicals from our environment , including bpa , contribute to diseases late in life ; yet , studies of how early life exposures specifically alter the immune system are limited . herein we report an examination of how maternal exposure to a low , environmentally relevant dose of bpa affects the immune response to infection with influenza a virus . we exposed female mice during pregnancy and through lactation to the oral reference dose for bpa listed by the us environmental protection agency , and comprehensively examined immune parameters directly linked to disease outcomes in adult offspring following infection with influenza a virus . we found that developmental exposure to bpa did not compromise disease - specific adaptive immunity against virus infection , or reduce the host ' s ability to clear the virus from the infected lung . however , maternal exposure to bpa transiently reduced the extent of infection - associated pulmonary inflammation and anti - viral gene expression in lung tissue . from these observations , we conclude that maternal exposure to bpa slightly modulates innate immunity in adult offspring , but does not impair the anti - viral adaptive immune response , which is critical for virus clearance and survival following influenza virus infection .	0

evaluation of the interface between one - bottle bonding agents and dentin by cryopreparation and low - temperature scanning electron microscopy ( ltsem ). a pilot study on perfused dentinal samples .. objectives : dentin bonding samples are generally observed in the high vacuum chamber of an electron microscope only after completion of the bonding procedure fixation , dehydration and drying of the specimens . the purpose of this study was to observe the effect of each step in the application of various one - bottle dentin bonding agents ( dba ) using cryopreparation followed by low - temperature scanning electron microscopy ( ltsem ). methods : prime & bond 2 . 1 ( p & b 2 . 1 ), coltène experimental ( exp .) and syntac single component ( syntac sc ) were applied onto perfused dentin of extracted , human third permanent molar teeth . after acid - etching , rinsing and drying , and following the application of the respective resins , the teeth were fractured at random and plunge - frozen in liquid nitrogen before examination under ltsem . as this method preserves the state of the treated surface at the moment when it is frozen , each step of the application of the dba can be observed as if it were a ' real - time ' procedure . results : acid - etching the dentin resulted in the removal of the smear layer for all materials tested . those one - bottle dbas which recommend the application of two consecutive resin layers ( p & b 2 . 1 and syntac sc ) showed incomplete saturation of the dentinal surface after application of the first layer . with syntac sc the incomplete saturation was more pronounced than with p & b 2 . 1 . the use of exp . resulted in a much more homogeneous coverage of the dentin despite only one layer of resin having been applied . conclusion : it is concluded that cryo - preparation followed by ltsem appears to be a method which allows each stage of the application of dba to be evaluated .	0
effect of commercially available bonding agents impregnated with fibers on bending strength of hybrid resin .. to clarify the mechanical properties of fiber - reinforced hybrid resin bridges , this study evaluated the influence of various bonding agents (( modeling liquid ( ml ), de resin ( de ), bell bond ( be ), mega bond ( mg ), durafil bond ( du ), fluoro bond ( fb ), mac - bond ( mc ), eg bond ( eg ), unifill bond ( un ), single bond ( sn )) impregnated with fibers on bending strength . fb attained the highest bending strength of 570 mpa , whereas sn exhibited the lowest value of 224 mpa , which meant that the bending strength of fb was 2 . 5 times higher than that of sn . results of this study suggested that the bending strength of fiber - reinforced hybrid resin was significantly affected by bonding agents impregnated with fibers . therefore , selection of bonding agent for hybrid resin restoration requires careful consideration of product composition to ensure an optimal bonding agent - fiber combination , thereby imparting improved mechanical properties to the resultant dental restoration .	0
collagen cross linking increases its biodegradation resistance in wet dentin bonding .. purpose : the biodegradation of exposed dentin collagen within the adhesive / dentin ( a / d ) interface is one of the main reasons for composite restoration failures and seriously affects the durability of dental restorations . in the present study , the objective was to investigate whether the inclusion of the cross - linking reagent ( glutaraldehyde , ga ) in the adhesive would increase collagen biodegradation resistance within the a / d interface . materials and methods : the model adhesive consisted of ~ 60 % monomers ( hema / bis - gma , 45 / 55 wt / wt ) and ~ 40 % ethanol as a solvent . 5 % ga was added to the above formulation . after the dentin surfaces were etched for 15 s with 35 % phosphoric acid , rinsed with water and blotted dry , adhesives both with and without ga were applied and polymerized by visible light for 20 s . these a / d specimens were immersed in the biodegradation solution ( prepared by adding 160 mg collagenase in 1 liter of tesca buffer solution ) for up to 30 days after proceeding with the sectioning / fracture to expose the a / d interfaces . the specimens were analyzed using sem and micro - raman spectroscopy . results : sem results indicated that for the adhesive without ga , there were many voids and a loss of collagen fibrils in the a / d interface after being challenged by the biodegradation solution . the raman spectra collected from the interface showed that the amide i of collagen at 1667 cm - 1 obviously decreased , indicating a removal of collagen fibrils during the degradation process . for the adhesive containing ga , the collagen fibrils within the interface did not degrade at all , which was also confirmed by the raman results . conclusion : the results corroborate the previous findings that by using the current adhesive system and wet bonding , the collagen fibrils in the a / d interface are largely unprotected and easily undergo biodegradation . directly including cross - linking agents in the adhesive could protect collagen fibrils from degradation in situ within the a / d interface .	0
bisphenol a in dental sealants and its estrogen like effect .. bisphenol a or bpa - based epoxy resins are widely used in the manufacture of commercial products , including dental resins , polycarbonate plastics , and the inner coating of food cans . bpa is a precursor to the resin monomer bis - gma . during the manufacturing process of bis - gma dental sealants , bisphenol a ( bpa ) might be present as an impurity or as a degradation product of bis - dma through esterases present in saliva . leaching of these monomers from resins can occur during the initial setting period and in conjunction with fluid sorption and desorption over time and this chemical leach from dental sealants may be bioactive . researchers found an estrogenic effect with bpa , bis - dma , and bis - gma because bpa lacks structural specificity as a natural ligand to the estrogen receptor . it generated considerable concern regarding the safety of dental resin materials . this review focuses on the bpa in dental sealants and its estrogen - like effect .	0
influence of incorporation of antibacterial monomer on curing behavior of a dental composite .. a newly developed monomer , methacryloyloxdodecylpyridinium bromide ( mdpb ), has an antibacterial activity against oral streptococci , and this monomer can be active even after being immobilized as one component of a cured composite . the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of incorporation of mdpb on the curing behavior of bis - gma - based composites . depth of cure , degree of cure , light - attenuating effect , and surface hardness of composites incorporating 0 . 4 or 0 . 5 % mdpb were measured and compared with those of a control material without mdpb . depth of cure of composites with mdpb , measured by means of a penetrometer , was greater than for the control ( p < 0 . 05 ). differential thermal analysis showed that composites with mdpb had a significantly greater degree of cure than the control ( p < 0 . 05 ). the light - attenuating effect of mdpb composites was less than for the control ( p < 0 . 05 ). no significant difference between experimental and control was obtained with respect to vickers hardness after both one day ' s and seven days ' storage in water . these results indicate that the incorporation of small quantities of mdpb into bis - gma - based composites did not adversely affect the cure performance . on the contrary , a significant , though small , improvement was observed .	0

introduction of a planar defect in a molecularly imprinted photonic crystal sensor for the detection of bisphenol a .. this paper reports the preparation of a molecularly imprinted inverse opal hydrogel containing a 2d defect layer , by combining the langmuir - blodgett technique and the photonic crystal template method . by coupling the exceptional characteristics of molecularly imprinted polymers , sensitive to the presence of a target molecule , and those of photonic crystals in a single device , we could obtain a defect - embedded imprinted photonic polymer consisting in a three - dimensional , highly - ordered and interconnected macroporous array , where nanocavities complementary to analytes in shape and binding sites are distributed . as a proof of concept , we prepared a three - dimensional macroporous array of poly ( methacrylic acid ) ( pmaa ) containing molecular imprints of bisphenol a ( bpa ) and a planar defect layer consisting in macropores of different size . the optical properties of the resulting inverse opal were investigated using reflection spectroscopy . the defect layer was shown to enhance the sensitivity of the photonic crystal material , opening new possibilities towards the development smart optical sensing devices .	0
the effect of ferrule on the fracture mode of endodontically treated canines restored with fibre posts and metal - ceramic or all - ceramic crowns .. objectives : the aim of this study was to evaluate the fracture mode of endodontically treated canines ( etc ) restored with glass - fibre posts ( gfp ) and either metal - ceramic ( mc ) or all - ceramic ( ac ) crowns , in the presence or absence of 2 mm ferrule height . methods : fifty recently extracted human maxillary canines were endodontically treated and randomly divided into 5 groups of 10 specimens each . four groups ( with or without ferrule ) were restored with gfp , composite cores and either mc or ac crowns . the fifth group with intact etc served as control . teeth were loaded to fracture at a 135 ° angle to their long axis , at a cross - head speed 0 . 5 mm / min . the fracture modes were divided through optical microscopy to repairable and irreparable . statistical analysis was performed by means of the fisher ' s exact test . results : all groups presented brittle fracture following bending deformation . irreparable root fractures were the primary fracture mode independently of ferrule . the percentages (%) of repairable fractures were not statistically significant different amongst the mc and ac restored teeth independently of ferrule . however the 2 mm ferrule was associated to a higher percentage of repairable fractures , especially in teeth restored with ac crowns . conclusions : the percentage (%) of repairable fractures was higher in all - ceramic compared to metal - ceramic etc and in restorations with ferrule , although the differences were not statistically significant . clinical significance : this in vitro study supports evidence that neither the type of crown restoration nor the presence of ferrule affects statistically significantly the mode of fracture of etc restored with gfp .	0
degree of conversion of composites measured by dta and ftir .. objective : differential thermal analysis ( dta ) using a split fiber optic light source has been reported to be a convenient method of measuring the degree of conversion ( dc ) of light - activated composites . the purpose of this study was to compare the results by dta and fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ), and evaluate the usefulness of the dta method . methods : experimental 2 , 2 - bis [ 4 -( 3 - methacryloyloxy - 2 - hydroxypropoxy ) phenyl ] propane - based composites containing sio2 filler and various amounts of triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ) were prepared , and the dc of each composite was determined by dta or ftir with 60s irradiation . the dc of three proprietary composites containing hybrid filler or prepolymerized resin filler were also measured by both methods with 20 or 60s irradiation . the results were analyzed by anova and fisher ' s protected least significant difference test . results : by both dta and ftir , the dc of experimental composites increased as the proportion of tegdma increased , although dta showed 3 - 10 % greater values ( p < 0 . 05 ) than ftir . for proprietary composites that contain hybrid filler , the values by dta were not significantly different from those by ftir at 20s exposure . longer irradiation time resulted in greater dc ( p < 0 . 05 ) for both methods , and dta showed 5 - 7 % greater values than ftir . however , the dc of the composite containing prepolymerized resin filler was 30 % less by ftir than by dta , possibly due to the influence of unpolymerized species in the filler . significance : the dc values determined by dta and ftir showed good agreement for most materials including model composites . in addition , dta may be more useful than ftir to measure the dc of composites containing prepolymerized resin filler .	0
in utero exposure to bisphenol - a and anogenital distance of male offspring .. background : bisphenol - a ( bpa ) is an endocrine disruptor with widespread human exposure . the effect of in utero bpa exposure on human offspring remains largely unknown . methods : anogenital distance ( agd ) of sons of workers who did or did not have occupational bpa exposure during pregnancy were compared in an occupational cohort study . parental bpa exposure level during the index pregnancy was estimated through a job - exposure matrix based on personal air sampling measurement . maternal exposure was considered direct in utero exposure to the fetus , whereas paternal exposure was considered indirect in utero exposure . results : a total of 153 boys were included in the final analysis , among them 56 with parental occupational exposure during pregnancy and 97 without . after controlling for the boys ' ages and weights using linear regression , parental occupational exposure to bpa during pregnancy was associated with shortened agd in male offspring . the association was stronger for maternal exposure ( p < 0 . 01 ). there was also a dose - response relationship with increased bpa exposure levels in pregnancy associated with greater magnitude of shortened agd in male offspring , with a statistically significant trend for the association ( p = 0 . 008 ). conclusion : our findings provide the first epidemiologic evidence that in utero bpa exposure may adversely affect male genital development .	0
preliminary study of responses in mussel ( mytilus edilus ) exposed to bisphenol a , diallyl phthalate and tetrabromodiphenyl ether .. environmental pollutants with hormonal activity including bisphenol , diallyl phtalate and tetrabromodiphenyl ether , have the potential to alter gonadal development and reproduction in aquatic wildlife . little is known about the biological impact of environmentally relevant concentrations in mussels . to investigate some aspects of their potential estrogenic action , mussels were continuously exposed during 3 weeks . gonadal development and vitellogenin like protein levels were examined . bisphenol ( 50 microg / l ) induced the expression of phospho - proteins in females and spawning in both sexes . diallyl phthalate and tetrabromodiphenyl ether decreased phospho - protein levels in both sexes and induced spawning in males . moreover , severe damaging effects on ovarian follicles and ovocytes were observed in both bisphenol a - and tetrabromodiphenyl ether - exposed female mussels .	0
effects of seawater pollutants on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in mussel tissues .. different exogenous compounds are known to stimulate tyrosine kinase signaling , and this could explain a wide spectrum of pollutant effects on different organisms . we studied the effects of various seawater contaminants on tyrosine phosphorylation levels in different tissues of the mussel ( mytilus edulis ), by using western immunoblotting . mussels were exposed in aquarium for 3 weeks to north sea oil alone or to a mixture of north sea oil , alkyl phenols , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ). in another experiment , mussels were exposed for 3 weeks to each of the following potential endocrine disruptors : bisphenol a , diallyl phthalate , or tetrabromodiphenylether - 47 . in a third experiment , mussels were caged at four sites along a copper field gradient . use of antiphosphotyrosine antibody showed that treatments with oil alone , or with oil , alkyl phenols and pah induced phosphorylation increases in the digestive gland , gills and mantle . bisphenol a produced significant effects in the gills and mantle , while diallyl phthalate and tetrabromodiphenylether - 47 had a slight effect only on the gill tissue . mussels exposed to the copper field gradient showed phosphotyrosine increases in the gills and mantle at intermediate levels of contamination . this latter result was also confirmed by using phosphospecific p38 antibody . in summary , the strength of induction was : oil mixture > oil > bisphenol a > or = copper ; while the degree of tissue responsiveness was : mantle > gill > digestive gland . based on these data , the use of tyrosine phosphorylation levels as a biomarker of seawater pollution is proposed .	0
sealing occlusal caries lesions in adults referred for restorative treatment : 2 - 3 years of follow - up .. the aim of this study was to assess the possibility to arrest occlusal caries lesions in adults by sealant as well as to assess the presence of radiographic progression , arrest , and regression of the sealed lesions . seventy - two occlusal caries lesions in 52 adult patients referred to restorative treatment by senior lecturers at school of dentistry , copenhagen , denmark were included . in case the patient had more than one occlusal caries lesion , randomization between sealing and restoration was made ; otherwise , the lesion was sealed . in total , 60 resin sealants and 12 composite restorations were made . follow - up period was 25 - 38 months ( mean = 33 months ). data were analyzed using non - parametric statistics including kappa statistics . after 2 - 3 years , the dropout rate was 15 %; two patients did not show up for control and nine previously sealed lesions were restored by the patients ' general practitioners . all 12 restorations and 39 of the remaining 49 sealants were well functioning , seven ( 14 %) sealants were repaired / replaced due to failure , and three ( 6 %) sealed lesions were restored due to caries progression ( p > 0 . 05 ). the radiographic assessment showed caries progression beneath five ( 10 %) sealants , caries regression beneath one ( 2 %) sealant , and unchanged depth beneath 43 ( 88 %) sealants and all restorations ( p > 0 . 05 ). the majority of the referred lesions were successfully arrested by sealants , indicating the possibility for extending the criteria for sealing occlusal caries lesions in adults . however , a longer observation period is needed for final conclusion . extending the criteria of therapeutic sealing of occlusal caries lesions in adults will lead to increased dental health .	0
preparation and characterization of cyclopolymerizable resin formulations .. an amine - catalyzed reaction between acrylates and formaldehyde has been used to convert mono - acrylates to difunctional monomers and di - acrylates to multifunctional oligomers by linking the acrylic double bonds together in 1 , 6 - diene pairs . the resulting monomers and oligomers undergo efficient cyclopolymerization to high conversion with significantly less shrinkage than normally found for acrylates . in this study , a convenient single - step process was used with mixtures of mono - and di - acrylate starting materials to produce a series of resins with potential for effective cyclopolymerization . incremental changes in the ethyl acrylate ( ea ) to ethoxylated bisphenol a diacrylate ( ebpad ) ratio directly supplied cyclopolymerizable resins with a broad range of viscosities and product distributions . those resins produced from reaction mixtures rich in ea have low viscosities because of high diluent monomer contents and limited oligomerization of ebpad due to end - cap formation . resin viscosity and average molecular weight of the oligomeric component of the resin were inversely related to the amount of ea used in the reaction . through the choice of reactants and their ratio , this simple technique has the potential to provide cyclopolymerizable resins for use in a variety of dental polymer applications .	0
[ sensitizing capacity , cross - reactivity and antigenic determinants of bisphenol a ].. bis - gma and epoxy resins are known to cause allergic reactions in some patients . the purpose of this research was to investigate the sensitizing capacity , cross - reactivity and antigenic determinants of bisphenol a ( bpa ), a major constituent of bis - gma and bpa type epoxy resins . anti - bpa antibodies were prepared from mice injected with bpa - ovalbumin conjugates ( bpa - ova ), and the reactions of the structurally bpa - related compounds were compared with that of bpa using these antibodies by the enzyme immunoassay ( eia ) and eia inhibition test . the findings are as follows : 1 ) injection of bpa failed to generate anti - bpa antibodies . however , injection of bpa - ova was effective in producing antibodies strongly reacting with bpa . 2 ) polyclonal anti - bpa antibodies cross - reacted with bisphenol b ( bpb ), p - isopropyl - phenol ( ipp ), diethylstilbestrol ( des ) and 2 , 4 - dinitrophenyl ( dnp ). 3 ) five kinds of monoclonal anti - bpa antibodies were obtained . these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with bpa and moderately cross - reacted with ipp , des and bpb , but not with dnp . the results suggest that bpa - ova is capable of eliciting anti - bpa antibody production in mice and that the antigenic determinant of bpa is the structure of one central carbon atom , covalently bound with two phenyl groups and two methyl groups .	0
preparation of microspheres and microcapsules by interfacial polycondensation techniques .. a methodological review of the production of microspheres / microcapsules by interfacial polycondensation is presented and the mechanisms of particle and capsule formation are discussed . procedures for interfacial polycondensation employed for the preparation of microspheres / microcapsules involve the polycondensation of two complementary monomers in a two phase suspension system . each of the two complementary monomers resides largely in one of the two immiscible phases in the suspension system . the resulting polycondensate , which is formed at or on one side of the interface , may , or may not , be soluble in the droplet phase . if the polymer is soluble in the droplets , particulate microspheres or monolithic microcapsules are formed , i . e . particle forming interfacial polycondensation . if the polymer is insoluble in the droplets , it forms a membrane around them , and the droplets are thus individually encapsulated by the polymer . this leads to the formation of capsular microspheres or reservoir microcapsules , and hence capsule forming interfacial polycondensation . a major example of particle forming interfacial polycondensation is that of phosgene with bisphenol a recently developed for the production of polycarbonate resins in particle form . capsule forming interfacial polycondensation is widely used to prepare polyamide ( nylon ) microcapsules containing proteins , pharmaceuticals , etc .	0

neuroprotective effects of arachidonic acid against oxidative stress on rat hippocampal slices .. arachidonic acid ( aa ), 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 - eicosateraenoic acid is abundant , active and necessary in the human body . in the present study , we reported the neuroprotective effects and mechanism of arachidonic acid on hippocampal slices insulted by glutamate , nan ( 3 ) or h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) in vitro . different types of models of brain injury in vitro were developed by 1mm glutamate , 10mm nan ( 3 ) or 2mm h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ). after 30 min of preincubation with arachidonic acid or linoleic acid , hippocampal slices were subjected to glutamate , nan ( 3 ) or h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ), then the tissue activities were evaluated by using the 2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride method . endogenous antioxidant enzymes activities ( sod , gsh - px and catalase ) in hippocampal slices were evaluated during the course of incubation . mk886 ( 5 microm ; a noncompetitive inhibitor of proliferator - activated receptor [ ppar ] alpha ), badge ( bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ; 100 microm ; an antagonist of ppargamma ) and cycloheximide ( chx ; 30 microm ; an inhibitor of protein synthesis ) were tested for their effects on the neuroprotection afforded by arachidonic acid . population spikes were recorded in randomly selected hippocapal slices . arachidonic acid ( 1 - 10 microm ) dose dependently protected hippocampal slices from glutamate and h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) injury ( p < 0 . 01 ), and arachidonic acid ( 10 microm ) can significantly improve the activities of cu / zn - sod in hippocampal slices after 1h incubation . in addition , 10 microm arachidonic acid significantly increased the activity of mn - sod and catalase , and decreased the activities of cu / zn - sod to control value after 3h incubation . these secondary changes of sod during incubation can be reversed by indomethacine ( 10 microm ; a nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor ) or aa 861 ( 20 microm ; a 5 - lipoxygenase inhibitor ). its neuroprotective effect was completely abolished by badge and chx . these observations reveal that arachidonic acid can defense against oxidative stress by boosting the internal antioxidant system of hippocampal slices . its neuroprotective effect may be mainly mediated by the activation of ppargamma and synthesis of new protein in tissue .	0
lack of significant alteration in the prostate or testis of f344 rat offspring after transplacental and lactational exposure to bisphenol a .. bisphenol a ( bpa ), a compound of great concern as an estrogenic xenobiotic , was assessed for its ability to cause alteration in the accessory sex organs and spermatogenesis in male offspring exposed preneonatally and neonatally . in a series of experiments focusing on rat sensitivity to gestational and lactational exposure to bpa , we investigated its effects on gestation period and reproductive organs in male offspring . in the first instance , bpa was administered to f344 female rats by gavage at 0 , 7 . 5 , 120 mg / kg / day during pregnancy and lactation period . there were no observable adverse effects in pregnant rats and the treatment did not induce any morphological abnormalities in the accessory sex organs of male offspring . however , lowered numbers of sperm in the testis were found with a dose of 120 mg / kg / day . in the second study , the same protocol with a higher number of male offspring was applied , but no reduction in the sperm count was apparent . we conclude that transplacental and lactational exposure to bpa dose not exert any adverse effects on morphogenesis of rat accessory sex organs or spermatogenesis .	0
characterization and in vitro estrogenicity of orthodontic adhesive particulates produced by simulated debonding .. objective : to investigate the structure and composition of ground orthodontic adhesive particulates produced under simulated clinical conditions and assess their estrogenic action in vitro . materials and methods : a chemically cured and a light - cured adhesive were included in the study . specimens were prepared by simulating bonding procedures , covering the bracket base surface with cellulose films to detach the full set material . the adhesives prepared under this method were grounded in glass chambers with an 8 - fluted tungsten carbide on a high - speed handpiece ; a new bur and different chamber was used for each adhesive sample and grindings were performed on different days to avoid contamination of the room . the adhesive particulates produced were subjected to ft - ir spectroscopy for the molecular characterization of particles ; scanning electron microscopy for the morphologic condition and structure ; and x - ray microanalysis for the elemental composition of the particles . amounts of the ground adhesives were immersed in saline for 1 month at 37 degrees c . eluents from solution of the two adhesives were added to media of an estrogen - responsive cell line derived from human breast adenocarcinoma ( mcf - 7 ), to assess the estrogenicity . positive ( estradiol and bisphenol - a ) and negative ( saline ) controls were used ; all assays were repeated four times and the results were averaged . estrogenicity data were analyzed with one - way anova and the tukey test at the . 05 level of significance . results : the study of the composition of particles revealed compounds related to monomers with no major differences noted . significant structural alterations were observed between the materials studied , with the chemically cured adhesive having larger particles . the ground samples contained si , na and al apparently deriving from fillers , whereas large ba fillers were identified only in the chemically cured group , whereas no distinct molecular variation was noted between the set material and its corresponding particulate form . both chemically cured and light - cured adhesives exhibited an estrogenic action through induction of the proliferation rate of mcf - 7 cells ( 160 % and 128 %, respectively , compared to control ). significance : apart from the potentially hazardous action of adhesive particulate aerosol produced by grinding , composite resin particulates may act as endocrinological disruptors .	0

prosthetic replacement of the hip in dogs using bioactive bone cement .. total hip arthroplasties were performed in dogs using bioactive bone cement consisting of silane treated cao - mgo - sio2 - p2o5 - caf2 glass powder as the filling particles and bisphenol - a - glycidyl methacrylate based resin as the organic matrix , and the outcomes were compared with the results of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement . the mechanical properties of the bioactive bone cement were stronger than the mechanical properties of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement . the bonding strength of the bioactive bone cement to bone in dogs ' femora increased with time , reaching 4 . 7 mpa at 6 months , whereas that of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement did not increase , remaining at 1 . 0 mpa . results of histologic examination showed direct bonding between the bioactive bone cement and bone , and the bony trabeculae around the cement mantle grew with time . however , in polymethylmethacrylate bone cement , an intervening soft tissue layer was evident at the bone cement interface . direct bonding of the bioactive bone cement at the interface through an apatite layer of 30 microm in thickness was shown through observation with the scanning electron microscopy . using this bioactive bone cement in clinical settings may help alleviate serious problems associated with cemented total hip arthroplasty , such as aseptic loosening of the implant and mechanical failure of the bone cement .	0
marginal quality and microleakage of adhesive class v restorations .. objectives : the aim of this in vitro study was to determine the marginal quality and microleakage of composite resin class v restorations . methods : standardized mixed class v cavities ( diameter : 4mm , depth : 2mm ) with half of the finish lines limited within dentin were cut in 90 freshly extracted human molars and randomly assigned to nine groups ( n = 10 ). after etching enamel and dentin , the cavities were restored with nine different restorative systems ( syntac sprint / tetric ceram = ss , syntac single - component / tetric ceram = sc , onestep / aeliteflo = os , aquaprep + onestep / aeliteflo = oa , prime & bond 2 . 1 / tph = pb , optibond solo / prodigy = op , singlebond / z100 = sb , tenure quik / marathon = tq , solobond m / arabesk = sm ) using a wet - bonding procedure . after finishing and polishing , the teeth were stored for 24h in distilled water at 37 degrees c before they were subjected to thermocycling ( 5 / 55 degrees c , 1000x ). epoxy replicas were made for margin analysis in the sem . specimens were stained in methylene blue , sectioned , and evaluated for microleakage . dye penetration was scored on a 0 - 3 ordinal scale . results : statistical analysis ( kruskal - wallis h - test , mann - whitney u - test ) revealed significant differences ( p < 0 . 05 ) among the groups at dentin and enamel margins for the microleakage scores as well as for the results of the quantitative sem margin analysis . sc revealed a significantly higher percentage of perfect margins in the sem than os and sm in enamel and dentin , respectively . oa exhibited significantly more leakage in enamel than all other groups . conclusions : none of the tested restorative systems achieved a perfect seal in dentin and enamel of mixed class v cavities . marginal quality and sealing ability of adhesive systems to dentin , using a wet - bonding procedure , is still inferior compared with enamel margins .	0
fine spatial assembly for construction of the phenol - binding pocket to capture bisphenol a in the human nuclear receptor estrogen - related receptor γ .. various lines of evidence have shown that bisphenol a ( bpa ) acts as an endocrine disruptor that affects various hormones even at merely physiological levels . we demonstrated recently that bpa binds strongly to human nuclear receptor estrogen - related receptor γ ( errγ ), one of 48 nuclear receptors . based on x - ray crystal analysis of the errγ ligand - binding domain ( lbd )/ bpa complex , we demonstrated that errγ receptor residues , glu275 and arg316 , function as the intrinsic - binding site of the phenol - hydroxyl group of bpa . if these phenol - hydroxyl ↔ glu275 and arg316 hydrogen bonds anchor the a - benzene ring of bpa , the benzene - phenyl group of bpa would be in a pocket constructed by specific amino acid side chain structures . in the present study , by evaluating the ala - replaced mutant receptors , we identified such a ligand - binding pocket . leu268 , leu271 , leu309 and tyr326 , in addition to the previously reported participants glu275 and arg316 , were found to make a receptacle pocket for the a - ring , whereas ile279 , ile310 and val313 were found to assist or structurally support these residues . the results revealed that each amino acid residue is an essential structural element for the strong binding of bpa to errγ .	0
influence of nd : yag laser irradiation on microtensile bond strength of adhesive systems to sound or carious dentin .. objective : to evaluate the microtensile bond strength of 2 adhesive systems ( adper single bond plus [ 3m espe ] and clearfil se bond [ kuraray ]) to carious or normal dentin , with or without previous treatment with nd : yag laser or nd : yag laser associated with fluoride . method and materials : dentin surfaces of 60 human third molars were exposed . teeth were divided into 12 groups ; groups 1 to 6 were submitted to ph cycling for artificial caries , and groups 7 to 12 remained with normal dentin . dentin surfaces received 3 treatments : laser nd : yag irradiation ( 60 mj , 15 hz , and 0 . 9 w ) for 1 minute ; laser nd : yag irradiation associated with fluoride in gel ; and no treatment ( controls ). in experimental groups , adhesive systems were applied in accordance with the manufacturers ' instructions , and a composite resin block ( filtek z250 , 3m espe ) was made incrementally for the microtensile bond strength test . the teeth were sectioned serially in both x and y directions , and sticks were submitted to microtensile bond strength testing in a universal testing machine . results : according to anova and tukey ( p < . 05 ), the highest mean bond strengths were obtained in groups of normal dentin treated with clearfil se bond ( 40 . 65 mpa ) and single bond ( 34 . 2 mpa ). the presence of carious dentin significantly decreased the mean bond strengths of the 2 adhesive systems whether or not they were previously laser irradiated . nevertheless , clearfil se bond presented the best microtensile bond strength on an irradiated surface . moreover , laser irradiation associated with fluoride also decreased the bond strength values of the 2 adhesive systems . conclusion : after excavating a cavity with caries - affected dentin , the use of nd : yag laser followed by a self - etching adhesive system is the best clinical choice when considering bond strength , compared with the total etching - based system and laser .	0
a synthetic antagonist for the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma inhibits adipocyte differentiation .. while searching for natural ligands for the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( ppar ) gamma , we identified a synthetic compound that binds to this receptor . bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) is a ligand for ppargamma with a k ( d ( app )) of 100 microm . this compound has no apparent ability to activate the transcriptional activity of ppargamma ; however , badge can antagonize the ability of agonist ligands such as rosiglitazone to activate the transcriptional and adipogenic action of this receptor . badge also specifically blocks the ability of natural adipogenic cell lines such as 3t3 - l1 and 3t3 - f442a cells to undergo hormone - mediated cell differentiation . these results provide the first pharmacological evidence that ppargamma activity is required for the hormonally induced differentiation of adipogenic cells .	0
statistical results on restorative dentistry experiments : effect of the interaction between main variables .. unlabelled : statistical analysis interpretation is a critical field in scientific research . when there is more than one main variable being studied in a research , the effect of the interaction between those variables is fundamental on experiments discussion . however , some doubts can occur when the p - value of the interaction is greater than the significance level . objective : to determine the most adequate interpretation for factorial experiments with p - values of the interaction nearly higher than the significance level . materials and methods : the p - values of the interactions found in two restorative dentistry experiments ( 0 . 053 and 0 . 068 ) were interpreted in two distinct ways : considering the interaction as not significant and as significant . results : different findings were observed between the two analyses , and studies results became more coherent when the significant interaction was used . conclusion : the p - value of the interaction between main variables must be analyzed with caution because it can change the outcomes of research studies . researchers are strongly advised to interpret carefully the results of their statistical analysis in order to discuss the findings of their experiments properly .	0
simple and rapid analysis of endocrine disruptors in liquid medicines and intravenous injection solutions by automated in - tube solid - phase microextraction / high performance liquid chromatography .. a simple and rapid method was developed for analyzing contamination of endocrine disruptors in liquid medicines and intravenous injection solutions . endocrine disrupting compounds such as bisphenol a ( bpa ), alkylphenols and phthalates were quantitated by on - line in - tube solid - phase microextraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography ( in - tube spme / hplc ) with uv detection . the liquid medicines and intravenous injection solutions could be used directly without any pretreatment , and the bpa , alkylphenols and phthalates in these solutions were automatically analyzed . the limits of quantification for these compounds were 1 - 10 ng / ml . recoveries of these compounds spiked to the intravenous injection solutions was over 80 %, except for some phthalates . di - n - butyl phthalate ( dbp ) was detected at a concentration of 7 - 60 ng / ml in most intravenous injection solutions in plastic containers , but it was not detected in solutions in glass bottles . diethyl phthalate , di - n - propyl phthalate , dbp and di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ( dehp ) were also detected in syrup , lotion and eye drops in plastic containers . on the other hand , bpa and alkylphenols were not detected at all in these solutions . dehp contamination from an administration set increased when total vitamin formulation was added to the infusion solution . dehp was easily leached from polyvinyl chloride tubing by polysorbate 80 . the in - tube spme / hplc method is simple , rapid and automatic , and it provides a useful tool for the screening and determination of endocrine disruptor contamination in liquid medicines and intravenous injection solutions .	0
preparation , morphological characterization , and activity of thin films of horseradish peroxidase .. active uniform films of horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) have been prepared by covalent binding on si / sio ( 2 ) or glass supports previously activated by silanization and succinylation . labeling by fluorescent or by electron spin resonance ( esr ) probes was used to quantify the surface density of active groups and of horseradish peroxidase . atomic force microscopy ( afm ) imaging was used to characterize the surface morphology . we observed that a non - uniform protein adsorption due to physical interactions was present when the supports were not activated for covalent binding and was , in large part , removed by washing . the enzyme deposited by covalent binding formed homogeneous layers with a height in the range 60 - 90 a . by using a fluorescent label , we calculated a protein density of 3 . 6 x 10 ( 12 ) molecules cm (- 2 ) on si / sio ( 2 ), corresponding to an estimated area per molecule of 2800 a ( 2 ) which is in agreement with the value expected on the basis of the crystallographic data considering the formation of a monomolecular layer . the protein density of the layer immobilized on glass was similar ( 1 . 9 x10 ( 12 ) molecules cm (- 2 )). the enzyme immobilized on both supports showed a k ( cat )/ k ( m ) being of the order of 3 - 5x10 ( 5 ) m (- 1 ) s (- 1 ) that is 1 / 20th of free hrp . the half - life time of the activity of the enzyme immobilized by covalent binding was longer than 40 days at 6 degrees c .	0
"""oxygen inhibition and incremental layer bond strengths of resin composites .. objectives : when dentists light cure resin composite restorations in increments or after contouring the surface layer to shape with a hand instrument the surface layer is exposed to air during polymerization . the presence of an oxygen inhibited resin surface layer may impact on clinical performance . conflicting data has been produced in vitro regarding this topic . methods : to shed further light on this subject the current investigation assessed the thickness of the oxygen inhibited layer ( oil ) and subsequent interfacial bond strength at various times post - cure of an """" initial increment """" for a range of experimental and commercial resin composites . the latter included conventional methacrylate - based composites and a novel low shrink silorane resin chemistry product . results : a decrease in composite viscosity brought about by an increase in diluent monomer content in the matrix for the experimental composite formulations led to increase in oil thickness . the oil surface layer thickness for the commercial methacrylate - based rbc specimens cured in air were 19 . 2 +/- 6 . 3 and 13 . 8 +/- 5 . 3 microm , respectively and 9 . 0 +/- 6 . 6 microm for silorane . no test material exhibited a measurable oil thickness polymerized in the nitrogen atmosphere . significance : from the current findings it may be concluded that incremental bond strength is not wholly reliant on surface inhibition since no differences in bond strength following immediate placement were observed between air and nitrogen atmosphere for any experimental or commercial material . for large restorations requiring multiple increments which are placed on fresh material , the bond strength between successive layers of silorane should be no different to conventional methacrylate materials . repair and bonding to aged silorane restorations may be more problematic as inferior incremental bond strengths ensued when addition was delayed ."""	0
polymerization shrinkage and contraction stress of dental resin composites .. objective : the aim of this study was to evaluate the shrinkage , contraction stress , tensile modulus , and the flow factor of 17 commercially available dental resin composites . method : the volumetric shrinkage measurements were performed by mercury dilatometry , and the contraction stress and tensile modulus were determined by means of stress - strain analysis . the statistical analysis was conducted by anova and tukey ' s post hoc test , and linear regression . results : strong linear correlation for most resin composites were found for ( i ) contraction stress and shrinkage ( ii ) contraction stress and tensile modulus , and ( iii ) shrinkage and tensile modules . for most of the materials the unpolymerized resin content determines the amount of shrinkage , contraction stress and tensile modules . the pre - polymerized clusters in heliomolar results in improved shrinkage / contraction stress properties . the shrinkage / contraction stress for filtek z100 , aelite flo , and flow - it was too high for the amount of resin in the resin composite . this was rationalized by high polymerization rates , a flow factor , and the nature of the resin . significance : high shrinkage and / or high contraction stress may lead to failure of the bond between the resin composites and the tooth structure . this study shows that the unpolymerized resin content determines the amount of shrinkage , contraction stress and tensile modules . therefore , using pre - polymerized clusters will improve shrinkage / contraction stress properties , as was shown in heliomolar , while high polymerization rates , and low flow factors have a deteriorative effect on the shrinkage / contraction stress properties .	0
effect of dentin desensitizers and dentin bonding agents on dentin permeability .. purpose : to determine the effect of dentin desensitizing agents ( oxalates and glutaraldehyde ) and dentin bonding agents , with and without resin - based composite ( rbc ) on dentin permeability and morphology of the dentin surface . the influence of saliva and toothbrushing on these agents was also evaluated . materials and methods : radicular dentin discs +/- 1 mm thick were obtained from extracted human teeth . the thickness of the discs was standardized by grinding them with 600 grit silicon carbide powder . both pulpal and periodontal surfaces of the discs were treated with 6 % citric acid for 2 min prior to the baseline measurement of dentin permeability . permeability was measured for the discs , using a split - chamber apparatus , at four different time points : at baseline , after treatment with each desensitizing modality , after 24 hrs of saliva immersion and after simulated toothbrushing equivalent to 3 weeks of normal brushing . the treatment modalities were : sensodyne dentin desensitizer , gluma dentin desensitizer , all - bond ds ( primers without etching ), etch + primers ( all - bond 2 system ), etch + primers + adhesive and etch + primers + adhesive + rbc ( aelite flo ). radicular dentin discs were prepared separately for scanning electron microscopy ( sem ). one group was left untreated as the control group . discs in the other groups were treated with the modalities listed above . one disc from each group was viewed under the sem after treatment with the desensitizing modality . the second disc in each group was viewed after 24 hrs of saliva immersion following desensitizing treatment and the third disc after 3 weeks of simulated toothbrushing following desensitizing treatment and saliva immersion . results : the greatest reduction in permeability was caused by all - bond ds followed by sensodyne dentin desensitizer and etch + primers + adhesive + rbc . gluma dentin desensitizer , etch + primers , and etch + primers + adhesive did not reduce permeability by a significant amount . saliva immersion increased permeability significantly only for the gluma and etch + primers + adhesive groups . there was a trend towards increase in permeability after toothbrushing ; however , this increase was not statistically significant for any group ( p > 0 . 05 ). thus , placement of primers without etching ( all - bond ds ) reduced permeability more than any other treatment modality . these data indicate that etching a sensitive dentin area may be appropriate only if rbc is to be placed in the area . exposure to saliva and toothbrushing countered the decrease in permeability caused by dedicated desensitizers and dentin bonding agents . the sem micrographs revealed that in most cases , form corroborated function and the morphology of the dentin surface corresponded to the dentin permeability values .	0
mitochondrial signaling pathway is also involved in bisphenol a induced germ cell apoptosis in testes .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a potential endocrine disruptor and testicular toxicant . an earlier study showed that bpa - induced germ cell apoptosis through the fas / fasl apoptotic pathway . in the present study , we aimed to investigate whether the mitochondrial pathway is also involved in the process of bpa - mediated germ cell apoptosis in testes . male mice were administered with bpa ( 160 or 480 mg / kg ) by gavage daily from postnatal day 35 ( pnd35 ) to pnd49 . germ cell apoptosis in testes was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( tdt )- mediated dutp nick - end labeling ( tunel ). as expected , the number of tunel + germ cells per tubule and the percentage of tubules with tunel + germ cells were significantly increased in testes of mice treated with bpa during puberty . tunel + germ cells were observed mainly in stages vii - viii seminiferous tubules in testes . an increase in the level of fas and fasl was observed in testes of mice exposed to bpa during puberty . in addition , pubertal bpa exposure evoked the activation of caspase - 8 and caspase - 3 in testes . interestingly , pubertal bpa exposure also caused the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol . in addition , pubertal bpa exposure upregulated the level of bax and active caspase - 9 in testes . taken together , these results suggest that pubertal bpa exposure induces germ cell apoptosis in testes through not only the fas / fasl signaling pathway but also the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway .	0

effect of occlusal load cycling on the marginal integrity of adhesive class v restorations .. the objective of this study was to evaluate the gingival wall marginal integrity of adhesive class v restorations subjected to occlusal load cycling . extracted lower first and second molar teeth were used . for each tooth , a class v cavity was prepared in the buccal or lingual surface with the gingival margin in the cementum . the cavities were restored with eight different adhesive systems : ( 1 ) ketac - fil ; ( 2 ) fuji ii lc ; ( 3 ) ketac - bond / pertac ; ( 4 ) photac - bond / pertac ; ( 5 ) scotchbond 2 / p50 ; ( 6 ) scotchbond multi - purpose / p50 ; ( 7 ) clearfil liner bond / clearfil photo posterior ; and ( 8 ) optibond / herculite xr . for each material - combination , three test procedures were carried out : no loading ( control ), loading at 125 n and at 250 n . six specimens were prepared for each procedure . the samples were loaded for 5000 cycles in a dye solution and kept in the dye for 24 hours after loading . control samples were stored in the dye for the same period . all teeth were sectioned and dye penetration at the gingival wall was scored from 0 to 4 . under control condition , only groups 2 , 6 , 7 and 8 showed perfect marginal integrity . after loading at 125 n , groups 1 , 3 and 5 showed significant increase in leakage ( p < 0 . 05 ). increasing the load to 250 n resulted in significant deterioration in the marginal adaptation of all test groups , except 6 and 7 . this study indicates that the marginal integrity of occlusally stressed adhesive class v restorations can only be preserved by a few products .	0
consortium - based science : the niehs ' s multipronged , collaborative approach to assessing the health effects of bisphenol a .. background : bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a high production volume chemical used to make polycarbonate plastic and is found in many consumer products . some studies using animal models have suggested that bpa exposures may have adverse health effects . however , research gaps have precluded a full understanding of the effects of bpa in humans and engendered controversies surrounding the chemical ' s potential toxicity . objectives : the national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) and national toxicology program ( ntp ) have developed an integrated , multipronged , consortium - based approach to optimize bpa - focused research investments to more effectively address data gaps and inform decision making . discussion : niehs / ntp bpa research investments made over the past 4 years include extramural research grants , establishment of a bpa grantee consortium , intramural research activities on bpa ' s mechanisms of action , the launch of two clinical studies and an occupational study , development of a round - robin experiment to validate bpa measurements in human serum , and , in collaboration with the food and drug administration ( fda ), formation of a consortium to design and execute a chronic toxicity study of bpa in rats . the niehs ' s new consortium - based approach has led to more integrated , collaborative efforts and should improve our ability to resolve controversies over the potential human health effects of exposures to low levels of endocrine - active agents .	0
effects of thermocycling , load - cycling , and blood contamination on cemented implant abutments .. this study compared the effects of thermocycling , load - cycling , and human blood contamination on the retentive strength of five different cements for luting posts to root - form implants . for each cement , 10 specimens ( controls ) were stored in an incubator , 10 specimens were thermocycled , 10 specimens were subjected to cyclic compressive loading , 10 specimens were subjected to a combination of thermocycling and cyclic compressive loading , and 10 specimens were contaminated with blood before cementation , then exposed to a combination of thermocycling and compressive loading . after 70 hours , retentive tests were performed on the instron machine , and data were recorded in kilograms . significant retentive differences were identified among the cements and with load - cycling , but minimal effect on the retentive strength was demonstrated from thermocycling . blood contamination in combination with thermocycling and load - cycling adversely affected the retentive strengths of all of the cements and could be a major cause of abutment failure in dental implants .	0
a morphological and micro - tensile bond strength evaluation of a single - bottle adhesive to caries - affected human dentine after four different caries removal techniques .. objectives : this study evaluated the influence of different caries removal techniques ( conventional bur ; chemomechanical removal / carisolv ()- mediteam ; a sonic preparation system / sonicsysmicro - kavo and air abrasion / prepstar - danville engineering ) on microtensile bond strength to caries - affected human dentine . methods : occlusal surfaces of extracted human permanent third molars with coronal dentine caries extending approximately halfway through the dentine was ground perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth to expose a flat surface of normal dentine surrounding the carious lesion with laser fluorescence values of approximately 30 ( diagnodent ), kavo ). carious lesions were excavated with one of the four techniques until laser fluorescence values decreased to 15 in the center of the lesions . an ethanol - based dentine adhesive ( single bond , 3m ) was used to bond composite resin ( p60 , 3m ) to the substrate . vertical slices ( n = 11 / group ), approximately 0 . 8 mm thick were made through the caries - affected portions of each tooth , perpendicular to the bonding surface . specimens were subjected to tensile stress at a crosshead speed of 1 mm / min . data were analyzed by kruskal - wallis test . sem investigation was performed for the qualitative evaluation of resin - dentine hybridization . results : the microtensile bond strengths were as follows ( mean +/- sd in mpa ): 6 . 4 +/- 5 . 3 ( bur ), 8 . 4 +/- 3 . 3 ( carisolv ), 8 . 5 +/- 5 . 9 ( sonicsys micro ), and 8 . 8 +/- 8 . 8 ( air abrasion ). statistical analysis did not show significant differences between any of the treatment modalities ( p = 0 . 160 ). tensile fracture was cohesive within caries - affected dentine in all specimens . conclusions : the four different caries removal techniques used within this study did not influence the bond strength of the tested dentine adhesive to caries - affected human dentine .	0

estrogenic compounds affect development of harpacticoid copepod tigriopus japonicus .. the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of estrogenic compounds on the harpacticoid copepod tigriopus japonicus after continuous exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations . natural estrogen ( 17beta - estradiol ), three known estrogenic compounds in vertebrates ( bisphenol a , 4 - nonylphenol , p - t - octylphenol ), and an invertebrate molting hormone ( 20 - hydroxyecdysone ) were tested for their effects on development and reproductive characters in two successive generations of t . japonicus . less than 24 - h - old nauplii ( parentals ) were exposed to four sublethal concentrations of these compounds for 21 d at 25 degrees c . the first brood of nauplii ( f1 ) produced was monitored further under the same culture conditions and exposures to test compounds . results showed that all estrogenic compounds affected development ( both in number of days to reach copepodid stage and sexual maturity ) in the parental generation . similar effects were apparent in the f1 ; however , fecundity , sex ratio , and survival were not significantly affected , even at concentrations as high as 10 microg / l ( nominal concentration ). the invertebrate molting hormone 20 - hyroxyecdysone had no detectable effect on any of the endpoints tested but gave the lowest 48 - h 50 % lethal concentration ( lc50 ) value . the results suggest that endocrine disruption could occur in copepods following exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of estrogenic compounds , especially if they are exposed starting from embryonic development .	0
effect of stepped light exposure on the volumetric polymerization shrinkage and bulk modulus of dental composites and an unfilled resin .. purpose : to compare the volumetric polymerization shrinkage and dynamic bulk modulus of five resins and an experimental unfilled resin polymerized with a stepped power light and with a conventional one step curing light . materials and methods : parallel sided glass rings 5 mm in diameter and 2 mm high were etched for 5 min with hydrofluoric acid and silanated . the density and volume of the rings were calculated before they were filled with either surefil , aeliteflo , pertac ii , z100 , or an experimental unfilled resin . when cured , the resin was bonded to the glass ring which produced a mold with a configuration c - factor of approximately 0 . 8 . the resin was cured for 40 s on each side using either a one step curing light or a stepped power curing light . after curing , the specimens were weighed in air and in water to calculate their final density and volumetric shrinkage . ten samples were made using each light system and for each resin ( total of 100 samples ). the bulk modulus was determined for each resin using an ultrasonic method , and the percentage filler contents were determined by thermogravimetric analysis . results : the mean +/- sd volumetric polymerization shrinkage values ranged from 3 . 10 +/- 1 . 19 % for surefil using the one step light to 12 . 35 +/- 1 . 38 % for the unfilled resin using the stepped power curing light . student - newman - keuls post hoc test separated the 10 different materials into three significant groups at p = 0 . 05 . the unfilled resin exhibited the highest volumetric shrinkage followed by the flowable composite ( aeliteflo ). for all materials tested , there was no significant difference in the volumetric shrinkage values when the resin was cured with the one step or the stepped power curing light . there was no significant difference in the volumetric shrinkage values for the hybrid composites ( pertac ii , z100 , and surefil ). the volumetric shrinkage values were highly sensitive to filler weight ( p < 0 . 001 ). except for z100 , there was no difference in the specific gravity values and velocities of the longitudinal and shear waves and bulk modulus when the one step and stepped power curing lights were used . the bulk modulus values ranged from 6 . 30 +/- 0 . 19 gpa for unfilled resin , to 17 . 10 +/- 1 . 09 gpa for z100 . curing with the one step or the stepped curing light had no significant effect on the modulus values for any resin with the exception of z100 , p = 0 . 05 . the bulk modulus values were highly sensitive to filler weight , and higher modulus values were associated with increased filler weight ( p < 0 . 001 ). there was no significant difference between the bulk modulus of pertac ii and surefil ( p = 0 . 05 ).	0
homeostatic imbalance and colon cancer : the dynamic epigenetic interplay of inflammation , environmental toxins , and chemopreventive plant compounds .. the advent of modern medicine has allowed for significant advances within the fields of emergency care , surgery , and infectious disease control . health threats that were historically responsible for immeasurable tolls on human life are now all but eradicated within certain populations , specifically those that enjoy higher degrees of socio - economic status and access to healthcare . however , modernization and its resulting lifestyle trends have ushered in a new era of chronic illness ; one in which an unprecedented number of people are estimated to contract cancer and other inflammatory diseases . here , we explore the idea that homeostasis has been redefined within just a few generations , and that diseases such as colorectal cancer are the result of fluctuating physiological and molecular imbalances . phytochemical - deprived , pro - inflammatory diets combined with low - dose exposures to environmental toxins , including bisphenol - a ( bpa ) and other endocrine disruptors , are now linked to increasing incidences of cancer in westernized societies and developing countries . there is recent evidence that disease determinants are likely set in utero and further perpetuated into adulthood dependent upon the innate and environmentally acquired phenotype unique to each individual . in order to address a disease as multi - factorial , case - specific , and remarkably adaptive as cancer , research must focus on its root causes in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which they can be prevented or counteracted via plant - derived compounds such as epigallocatechin - 3 - gallate ( egcg ) and resveratrol . the significant role of epigenetics in the regulation of these complex processes is emphasized here to form a comprehensive view of the dynamic interactions that influence modern - day carcinogenesis , and how sensibly restoring homeostatic balance may be the key to the cancer riddle .	0
promoting insulin secretion in pancreatic islets by means of bisphenol a and nonylphenol via intracellular estrogen receptors .. in this study , we investigated the effects of endocrine disrupters bisphenol a ( bpa ) and nonylphenol ( np ) on insulin secretion from rat pancreatic islets . following acute exposure to bpa and np , neither bpa nor np ( 0 . 1 , 1 , 10 , 100 and 1000 microg / l ) affected insulin secretion in concentrations of 16 . 7 mm glucose . however , insulin secretion following long - term exposure to bpa or np for 24 h in 16 . 7 mm glucose was significantly higher than without exposure . to determine whether increased insulin secretion resulting from long - term exposure to bpa and np is induced via intracellular estrogen receptors , we blocked the cytosolic / nuclear estrogen receptors , using actinomycin - d ( act - d ), an inhibitor of rna synthesis , and ici 182 , 780 ( ici ), an estrogen receptor inhibitor . following long - term exposure to bpa ( 10 microg / l ) or np ( 10 microg / l ), act - d or ici treatment eliminated the facilitation of insulin secretion . in conclusion , we have demonstrated for the first time that long - term exposure to endocrine disrupters , such as bpa and np , promotes in vitro insulin secretion from the pancreatic islets , via cytosolic / nuclear estrogen receptors .	0
the intersection of neurotoxicology and endocrine disruption .. endocrine disruption , the guiding theme of the 27th international neurotoxicology conference , merged into the neurotoxicology agenda largely because hormones help steer the process of brain development . although the disruption motif first attracted public health attention because of reproductive anomalies in both wildlife and humans , the neurobehavioral implications had been planted decades earlier . they stemmed from the principle that sex differences in behavior are primarily the outcomes of differences in how the brain is sexually differentiated during early development by gonadal hormones ( the organizational hypothesis ). we also now understand that environmental chemicals are capable of altering these underlying events and processes . among those chemicals , the group labeled as endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) offers the clearest evidence of such selectivity , a consequence of their actions on the endogenous sex steroids , androgens and estrogens . two edcs in particular offer useful and intriguing examples . one is phthalate esters . the other is bisphenol a . both agents are used extensively in plastics manufacture , and are pervasive in the environment . both are produced in immense quantities . both are found in almost all humans . phthalates are considered to function in essence as anti - androgens , while bisphenol a is labeled as an estrogen . their associations with brain sexual differentiation are reviewed and further questions noted . both edcs produce a wider spectrum of health effects , however , than would be extrapolated simply from their properties as anti - androgens and estrogens . obesity is one example . further complicating their assessment as health risks are questions about nonmonotonic dose - response functions and about transgenerational effects incurred via epigenetic mechanisms . all these facets of endocrine disruption are pieces of a puzzle that challenge neurotoxicologists for solutions .	1
determination and assessment of estradiol - mimicking compounds in the dissolved and particulate phases of wastewater treatment plant samples .. during the last two decades , a large number of publications have clearly shown that anthropogenic compounds that disrupt the endocrine system of wildlife species are a major cause for concern , and this concern has led to a demand for new screening methods . in this work , we have optimized and applied a new method to identify endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ), such as nonylphenol , octylphenol , and their corresponding ethoxylates , 17alpha - ethynylestradiol , bisphenol - a , 17beta - estradiol , and estriol , in sewage samples . for the extraction and preconcentration of all analytes from the dissolved and particulate phases , we used spe and ultrasonic assisted extraction , respectively . identification and quantification were achieved by hplc with fluorescence detection . satisfactory lods ( between 0 . 5 and 7 . 6 ng / l in the dissolved phase and 12 . 3 and 21 . 4 ng / g in the particulate phase ) and analyte recoveries ( between 67 and 102 %) were achieved for the target compounds . the optimized method was applied to the determination of edcs in liquid sewage samples collected from july 2009 to july 2010 from a wastewater treatment plant in las palmas de g . c . ( spain ). concentrations of edcs ranged from < 10 to nearly 1300 ng / l in the dissolved phase , and from 0 . 1 to 7 . 7 microg / g in the suspended particulate matter .	0
development and characterization of a biodegradable polyphosphate .. a biodegradable polyphosphate polymer ( mn = 18 , 000 , mw / mn = 3 . 2 ) matrix system was developed as a potential delivery vehicle for growth factors . as a model system , release of recombinant human osteogenic protein - 1 ( op - 1 ) from this polymer was evaluated . the polyphosphate was synthesized using a triethylamine catalyst in an argon environment , and characterized using elemental analysis , gel permeation chromatography ( gpc ), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ). degradation kinetics of the polyphosphate polymer in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) were represented by a second - order polynomial while degradation in bovine serum was linear with time . the polymer degraded faster in pbs than in bovine serum . in vitro release of op - 1 was also faster in pbs than in serum . release kinetics of op - 1 in pbs and serum were represented by second - order polynomials . the op - 1 release from this physically dispersed polymeric matrix may be described by several possible mechanisms : diffusion , bulk polymer degradation , ion complexation , and interactions among the protein ( op - 1 ), polymer , proteins , and enzymes in the media . this polyphosphate may be an effective carrier for morphogens , growth factors , or other classes of bioactive molecules .	0
"""two - year bond strengths of """" all - in - one """" adhesives to dentine .. objectives : to test the long - term in vitro bonding performance of """" all - in - one """" self - etch adhesives to dentine . methods : adper prompt ( 3m espe ), bond force ( tokuyama ), brush & bond ( parkell ), ibond self etch ( heraeus kulzer ), optibond all - in - one ( kerr ), and xeno iv ( dentsply caulk ) were tested . the two - step self - etch adhesive clearfil se bond ( kuraray ) served as the control . extracted human teeth were assigned to groups after creation of smear layer on occlusal dentine . adhesives were applied according to manufacturers ' instructions , and resin composite ( filtek z250 , 3m espe ) build - ups were placed . the bonded specimens were sectioned into beams after 24h of storage in water . microtensile bond strengths ( μtbs ) was determined at baseline , and following one and two years of water storage using an ez - test device ( shimadzu ). representative specimens were examined under field emission scanning electron microscope . fracture mode was recorded . the data were analyzed using linear mixed effects and least square means analyses . the significance level was set at 0 . 01 for the pairwise comparisons and at 0 . 05 for the overall model effects . results : the mean μtbs decreased significantly over time for adper prompt , ibond self etch , and optibond all - in - one . after two years of water ageing , bond force , brush & bond , optibond all - in - one , and xeno iv had mean μtbs values not statistically different from clearfil se bond . conclusions : after two years of water ageing , clearfil se bond outperformed two of six all - in - one adhesives . that indicates that the composition of the adhesives rather than their application approach is accountable for their performance . clinical significance : despite the data available suggesting that most all - in - one adhesives are severely affected by hydrolytic degradation , results of the present in vitro study suggest that some may perform as well as the clinically proven clearfil se bond in the longer term ."""	0
elution of tegdma and bisgma from a resin and a resin composite cured with halogen or plasma light .. plasma arc light units for curing resin composites have been introduced with the claim of relatively short curing times . the purpose of the present study was to measure and compare elution of monomers from an experimental bisgma - tegdma resin and a commercial resin composite when cured with a halogen unit and when cured with a plasma arc unit . specimens of the materials were immersed in methanol , and the amounts of monomers released with time were analyzed by hplc . by use of fick ' s laws of diffusion , the amount of eluted monomers from the specimen at infinity was estimated . the elution from resin specimens and from resin composite specimens cured with the plasma arc light unit was 7 and 4 times higher , respectively , compared to the elution from specimens cured with the halogen unit . it was concluded that the plasma arc light curing unit did not provide optimal cure when used as recommended by the manufacturer .	0
effect of plasma arc curing on the microleakage of class v resin - based composite restorations .. purpose : to evaluate the effect of plasma arc light - curing on the microleakage of class v resin - based composite ( rbc ). materials and methods : facial and lingual class v cavities were prepared at the cemento - enamel junction of extracted third molars . restorations of the two materials ( z250 ; amelogen ) were placed , using the supplied dentin adhesives ( single bond ; pq 1 , respectively ), and light - cured by either a halogen light curing unit ( h ) or a plasma arc curing unit ( p ). after thermal cycling , the teeth were immersed in methylene blue dye , then sections of the restored teeth were visually assessed for leakage . results : no leakage was observed at the interface between enamel and rbc in any restoration in this study . at gingival margins , the incidence of leakage ( slight / severe ) was : z250 h = 2 / 4 , p = 6 / 6 ; amelogen h = 3 / 4 , p = 1 / 12 , where n = 16 . the greatest incidence of leakage was observed in restorations cured by the plasma arc method . a two - way anova of leakage data rankings showed curing method to be a significant factor ( p = 0 . 002 ), restorative material not to be a significant factor ( p = 0 . 24 ), and no significant interaction between material and curing method ( p = 0 . 38 ).	0
effect of stepped vs . continuous light curing exposure on bond strengths to dentin .. purpose : to compare the 10 - min and 24 - hr shear bond strengths of three dentin bonding systems , polymerized with either a standard ( optilux 401 ) light for 60 s , or a stepped curing light ( elipar highlight ) that delivered a low light intensity for 10 s followed by high intensity for 50 s . materials and methods : three bonding systems were used to bond two resin - based composites ( rbc ) to dentin at 34 degrees +/- 2c using the two curing lights . single bond ( sb ) and prime & bond 2 . 1 ( p & b ) were used with z100 rbc , and ebs bonding system was used with pertac ii rbc . ten specimens from each combination were debonded at 37 degrees +/- 1c 10 min after starting to light cure the bonding system . ten other specimens were stored in water at 37 degrees +/- 1c for 24 hrs before debonding at 37 degrees +/- 1c ( total 120 teeth ). results : the 10 - min mean shear bond strengths were : standard cure ; ebs 11 . 9 +/- 2 . 9 mpa , sb 14 . 6 +/- 2 . 2 mpa , p & b 14 . 7 +/- 4 . 2 mpa : stepped curing ; ebs 7 . 4 +/- 2 . 1 mpa , sb 13 . 0 +/- 3 . 6 mpa , p & b 15 . 6 +/- 4 . 8 mpa . the 24 - hr mean shear bond strengths were : standard cure ; ebs 14 . 8 +/- 5 . 1 mpa , sb 25 . 1 +/- 3 . 3 mpa , p & b 25 . 2 +/- 8 . 8 mpa : stepped curing ; ebs 15 . 1 +/- 4 . 6 mpa , sb 21 . 9 +/- 5 . 9 mpa , p & b 17 . 3 +/- 9 . 2 mpa . three way anova showed significant main effects for light , bonding system and time and no 2 - or 3 - way interaction effects at p = 0 . 01 . the least - squares means test with sidak ' s adjustment for multiple comparisons showed that the bond strengths obtained using the standard light were significantly greater than the bond strengths obtained using the stepped curing light ( p < 0 . 01 ). the 24 - hr bond strengths were significantly greater ( p < 0 . 01 ) than the 10 - min bond strengths . the bond strengths obtained with ebs were significantly less than sb and p & b ( p < 0 . 01 ), but there were no significant differences between sb and pb ( p = 0 . 9752 ).	0
adsorption of zirconyl salts and their acids on hydroxyapatite : use of the salts as coupling agents to dental polymer composites .. zirconyl methacrylate ( i ) and zirconyl - 2 - ethylhexanoate ( ii ) were synthesized , and their adsorption isotherms from solutions onto synthetic hydroxyapatite were studied . the isotherms of methacrylic and 2 - ethylhexanoic acids were also determined from the same solvents . the adsorption of i was irreversible from methylene chloride , and that of ii was irreversible from cyclohexane . the adsorption in both cases was constant from solutions above a certain concentration , and exhaustive below this threshold concentration . both compounds rendered the dried apatite powder extremely hydrophobic ; however , the adsorbate was slowly washed off by excess water . the configuration of the adsorbate molecules , deduced from the maximum adsorption and other adsorption characteristics of the two compounds , indicated that : ( i ) in both cases the adsorbate may be held to the surface by concerted hydrogen bonding of the carboxylate and zirconyl oxygen atoms ; and ( ii ) the hydrocarbon moieties in both adsorbates expose themselves toward the solution , thereby making the dried surface hydrophobic . the adsorptive behavior of the respective acids was similar to that of the salts . polymer , filled with synthetic hydroxyapatite covered with irreversibly adsorbed i , had a diametral tensile strength about 50 % greater than that of the polymer filled with untreated apatite . the strength of the composite was not affected by treatment of the apatite with ii or with the acids .	0
[ study on the relationship between deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate ( dntp ) pools and cell transformation ].. deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate ( dntp ) pools were measured in normal balb / c3t3 cells , transformation - treated cells and transformed cells with reverse - phase hplc . the fluctuation of dntp pools was similar after cells were treated with alkylating mutagens glycidyl methacrylate ( gma ) and n - methyl - n '- nitro - n - nitrosoguanidine ( mnng ). the gap between ( dgtp + datp ) pools and ( dttp + dctp ) pools was greatly intensified . the measurements also indicated that the dntp pools in transformed cells were quite different from those in normal cells . the results suggest that dntp pools may play an important role in cell transformation .	0
biodegradation of bisphenol a and other bisphenols by a gram - negative aerobic bacterium .. a novel bacterium designated strain mv1 was isolated from a sludge enrichment taken from the wastewater treatment plant at a plastics manufacturing facility and shown to degrade 2 , 2 - bis ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) propane ( 4 , 4 '- isopropylidenediphenol or bisphenol a ). strain mv1 is a gram - negative , aerobic bacillus that grows on bisphenol a as a sole source of carbon and energy . total carbon analysis for bisphenol a degradation demonstrated that 60 % of the carbon was mineralized to co2 , 20 % was associated with the bacterial cells , and 20 % was converted to soluble organic compounds . metabolic intermediates detected in the culture medium during growth on bisphenol a were identified as 4 - hydroxybenzoic acid , 4 - hydroxyacetophenone , 2 , 2 - bis ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl )- 1 - propanol , and 2 , 3 - bis ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl )- 1 , 2 - propanediol . most of the bisphenol a degraded by strain mv1 is cleaved in some way to form 4 - hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 - hydroxyacetophenone , which are subsequently mineralized or assimilated into cell carbon . in addition , about 20 % of the bisphenol a is hydroxylated to form 2 , 2 - bis ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl )- 1 - propanol , which is slowly biotransformed to 2 , 3 - bis ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl )- 1 , 2 - propanediol . cells that were grown on bisphenol a degraded a variety of bisphenol alkanes , hydroxylated benzoic acids , and hydroxylated acetophenones during resting - cell assays . transmission electron microscopy of cells grown on bisphenol a revealed lipid storage granules and intracytoplasmic membranes .	0
gc - ms analysis of bisphenol a in human placental and fetal liver samples .. a method based on extraction with acetonitrile , followed by solid - phase extraction , derivatization with acetic anhydride , and isotope dilution gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ) analysis was applied to determine levels of free and conjugated bpa in human tissues . β - glucuronidase was used to de - conjugate the glucuronized bpa in the samples . the method was validated using various animal organ meat samples including pork liver and kidney , beef and calf liver , chicken liver and heart ; recoveries were from 85 % to 112 % at two spiking levels . the average method limit of quantification ( loq ) was estimated at 0 . 77 ng / g for placenta samples and 1 . 2 ng / g for fetal liver samples based on 10 times the signal to noise ratio . bpa was detected in all animal tissue samples , with concentrations ranging from 1 . 8 ng / g in beef and calf livers to 17 . 1 ng / g in pork kidney . the method was used successfully to determine both free and conjugated bpa levels in human placental and fetal liver tissue samples . bpa was detected in 86 % of the placental samples ; concentrations of free bpa in the positive samples ranged from 0 . 60 ng / g to as high as 64 ng / g with an average of 9 . 5 ng / g and a median of 3 . 0 ng / g , and conjugated bpa was as high as 7 . 8 ng / g . bpa was also detected in most of the fetal liver samples ( 57 %); concentrations of free bpa in the positive samples ranged from 1 . 3 to 27 ng / g with an average of 8 . 5 ng / g and a median of 3 . 2 ng / g . conjugated bpa was also detected in most of the liver samples analysed for total bpa , ranging from 0 . 64 to 20 ng / g with an average of 3 . 9 ng / g and a median of 1 . 5 ng / g . this study , while primarily designed as a method validation , has demonstrated that bpa can be detected in human fetal liver samples as early as the third month of fetal life . further work will be conducted to validate these preliminary findings .	0

knockdown of the gene encoding drosophila tribbles homologue 3 ( trib3 ) improves insulin sensitivity through peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - γ ( ppar - γ ) activation in a rat model of insulin resistance .. aims / hypothesis : insulin action is purportedly modulated by drosophila tribbles homologue 3 ( trib3 ), which in vitro prevents thymoma viral proto - oncogene ( akt ) and peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - γ ( ppar - γ ) activation . however , the physiological impact of trib3 action in vivo remains controversial . methods : we investigated the role of trib3 in rats treated with either a control or trib3 antisense oligonucleotide ( aso ). tissue - specific insulin sensitivity was assessed in vivo using a euglycaemic - hyperinsulinaemic clamp . a separate group was treated with the ppar - γ antagonist bisphenol - a - diglycidyl ether ( badge ) to assess the role of ppar - γ in mediating the response to trib3 aso . results : trib3 aso treatment specifically reduced trib3 expression by 70 % to 80 % in liver and white adipose tissue . fasting plasma glucose , insulin concentrations and basal rate of endogenous glucose production were unchanged . however , trib3 aso increased insulin - stimulated whole - body glucose uptake by ~ 50 % during the euglycaemic - hyperinsulinaemic clamp . this was attributable to improved skeletal muscle glucose uptake . despite the reduction of trib3 expression , akt2 activity was not increased . trib3 aso increased white adipose tissue mass by 70 % and expression of ppar - γ and its key target genes , raising the possibility that trib3 aso improves insulin sensitivity primarily in a ppar - γ - dependent manner . co - treatment with badge blunted the expansion of white adipose tissue and abrogated the insulin - sensitising effects of trib3 aso . finally , trib3 aso also increased plasma hdl - cholesterol , a change that persisted with badge co - treatment . conclusions / interpretation : these data suggest that trib3 inhibition improves insulin sensitivity in vivo primarily in a ppar - γ - dependent manner and without any change in akt2 activity .	0
microarray analysis of bisphenol a - induced changes in gene expression in human oral epithelial cells .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a common ingredient in dental materials . however , its potential adverse effects on the oral cavity are unknown . the purpose of this study is to identify the genes responding to bpa in a human oral epithelial cell line using dna microarray . of the 10 , 368 genes examined , changes in mrna levels were detected in seven genes : five were up - regulated and two were down - regulated . the expression levels of the calcium channel , voltage - dependent , l - type , alpha 1c subunit ( cacna1c ), cell death activator cide - 3 ( cide - 3 ), haptoglobin - related protein ( hpr ), importin 4 ( ipo4 ), and pou domain , class 2 and transcription factor 3 ( pou2f3 ) were significantly up - regulated in the cells exposed to 100 mm bpa . the spermatogenesis - associated , serine - rich 2 ( spats2 ) and hspc049 protein ( hspc049 ) were significantly down - regulated . the detailed knowledge of the changes in gene expression obtained using microarray technology will provide a basis for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the toxic effects of bpa in the oral cavity .	0
the influence of convergence angle and dentin micromorphology on shear bond strength of adhesive resin luting cement .. purpose : to determine the influence of convergence angles and axial planes on shear bond strength between dentin and adhesive composite resin luting cement , and its relation to dentin micromorphology . materials and methods : the four axial planes of 60 intact extracted mandibular molars were prepared at either 4 or 20 degrees to the longitudinal tooth axis . a teflon cylindrical mold ( 1 . 6 mm ) was filled with rely x - arc , bonded to single bond treated dentin surface and tested for shear bond strength after 7 days . three sem micrographs ( 5000x magnification ) were taken from each surface after removing the bonding layer . the tubule circumference was marked using adobe photoshop . micromorphology parameters were analyzed with the matlab program . a mixed effect linear model and linear regression were performed to analyze the influence of tubule density , tubule area , tubule circumference , and residual dentin thickness on shear bond strength . results : the shear bond strength was not significantly different between axial planes ( p > 0 . 05 ), but was significantly higher at 4 degrees than at 20 degrees ( p = 0 . 009 ). a significant positive correlation was found between shear bond strength and tubule area ( r = 0 . 43 , p = 0 . 003 ) or tubule circumference ( r = 0 . 42 , p = 0 . 003 ), confirming the importance of resin penetration into the tubules . no correlation was found between shear bond strength and tubule density ( r = 0 . 22 , p > 0 . 05 ) or residual dentin thickness ( r = - 0 . 22 , p > 0 . 05 ). more round and more elliptic tubule orifices characterized dentin prepared at 4 and 20 degrees , respectively . conclusion : regional variations in tubule cross - section appearance can modify the bond strength of adhesive resin luting cements .	0

in vitro shear bond strength of dual - curing resin cements to two different high - strength ceramic materials with different surface texture .. objective : the purpose of this study was to evaluate the shear bond strength ( sbs ) of two dual - curing resin cements to two high - strength ceramics with different surface texture . material and methods : composite cylinders were bonded to aluminum oxide ( a ) and zirconium oxide ( z ) ceramic disks with six different surfaces . investigated surfaces were for both ceramics : dry - pressed procera crown ( a1 , z1 ), machined procera bridge ( a2 , z2 ), airborne particle abraded procera bridge ( a3 , z3 ). additional surfaces were , for alumina , dry - pressed procera laminate ( a4 ) and , for zirconia , two modified surfaces ( z4 , z5 ). two adhesive resin cements were used ( clearfil esthetic and relyx arc ). sbs was tested in a universal testing machine before and after artificial aging by thermal cycling . results : mean sbs ranged from 6 . 1 to 38 . 4 mpa before and from 0 . 0 to 41 . 4 mpa after aging . clearfil esthetic in a3 , a4 , and z3 performed better than relyx arc . aging decreased sbs , except for z1 , z4 , and z5 . for alumina , a4 was higher in sbs than a2 , but similar to a1 and a3 . for zirconia , z5 showed the highest sbs . z4 was higher than z2 and z3 , but similar to z1 . conclusions : shear bond strength to alumina and zirconia increases with surface roughness . the modified zirconia surface z5 provides stable long - term shear bond strength and can be bonded to either of the two used cements .	0
bisphenol a 3 , 4 - quinone induces the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase into oxidase in vitro .. in the present study , we assessed the influence of bisphenol a ( bpa ) and bisphenol a 3 , 4 - quinone ( bpaq ) on the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase ( xd ) into xanthine oxidase ( xo ) in the rat liver in vitro . bpa up to 100 micromol / l did not affect the xo and xd activities in the partially purified cytosolic fraction from rat liver , whereas bpaq ( 2 - 10 micromol / l ) dose - dependently enhanced the xo activity concomitant with a decrease in the xd activity , implying that bpaq , but not bpa , can convert xd into the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) producing the form xo . furthermore , it was found that bpaq could increase the generation of ros and oxidize the guanine moiety of deoxyguanosine in the dna of primary rat hepatocyte cultures . these results suggest that bpaq has the potential to convert xd into xo in the liver , which in turn may lead to ros generation and oxidative dna damage in this region .	0
a zno - doped adhesive reduced collagen degradation favouring dentine remineralization .. objectives : the objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of a zno - doped etch and rinse adhesive in decreasing mmps - mediated collagen degradation at the resin - dentine hybrid layer , and increasing bonding stability . methods : c - terminal telopeptide concentrations ( ictp ) were determined after 24h , 1wk and 4wk in human dentine beams . dentine was treated : ( 1 ) 37 % phosphoric acid for 15s ( pa ), ( 2 ) pa - etched dentine infiltrated with single bond ( sb ), ( 3 ) pa - etched dentine infiltrated with zno doped sb ( zno particles -- 10wt %-- were added to the bonding resin ) ( zno - sb ), and ( 4 ) clearfil se bond primed - dentine was infiltrated with clearfil se bonding resin ( cse ). microtensile bond strength ( mtbs ) was assessed for the different groups at 24h and after 3months . debonded dentine surfaces were studied by scanning electron microscopy . results : mmps - mediated collagen degradation occurred in demineralized dentine ( pa ). resin infiltration decreased collagen degradation . the lowest collagen degradation was found for zn - doped sb , followed by cse . when these adhesives were applied , ictp values did not change throughout the study period . at 24h , similar mtbs was attained for all adhesives . only sb decreased mtbs after three months . conclusions : addition of zno particles to sb produced a reduction in dentine collagen degradation and increased resin - dentine bonds durability . in zn - doped adhesive interfaces , a calcium phosphate layer and tubular occlusion was encountered at the debonded interface . clinical significance : zno particles addition into the bonding resin of sb makes a breakthrough to prevent the hybrid layer degradation and to preserve its bonding efficacy overtime .	0
[ endocrine disruptors in food contact articles and baby toys with their transition ].. a number of endocrine disruptors have been reported in food contact articles and baby toys mainly during the second half of the 1990s . bisphenol a , nonylphenol , phthalates , styrene dimers and trimers , and their transision are described in this article . bisphenol a was found in polycarbonate tableware , nursing bottles and the epoxy resin coating of cans , therefore , it was also found in the canned foods and drinks . polycarbonate is now only slightly used for tableware or nursing bottles in japan because consumers refused them . the can manufacturers changed their coating material to the low bisphenol a resin or pet films and voluntarily regulate its migration limit to under 5 or 10 ng / ml . nonylphenol was found in most pvc wrapping films and gloves . it was generated from an oxidant , tris ( nonylphenyl ) phosphite . pvc wrapping film was extensively used in markets , thus many kinds of foods were contaminated . among them , fillet or minced fish and meat contained it at high levels . in 2000 , manufacturers voluntarily changed their composition and all wrapping films in japan no longer contain nonylphenol . di ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) was found in pvc gloves , which contaminated packed lunches and hospital meals at high levels . the government prohibited these gloves for all food contact use in 2000 , moreover , other pvc food contact articles containing dehp were prohibited for contact use with fatty foods in 2002 . dehp was also found in pvc toys which was prohibited in 2002 . styrene dimers and trimers were found in ps products , which migrated into cupped noodles after cooking . no changes have been made in them . in japan , the exposure to bisphenol a , nonylphenol and dehp have been significantly reduced and people also have more concerns with the safety of food contact articles .	0

pharmacokinetics of bisphenol a released from a dental sealant .. background : limited information is available regarding potentially estrogenic bisphenol a , or bpa , released from dental sealants . this study determined the rate - and time - course of bpa released from a dental sealant ( delton opaque light - cure pit and fissure sealant , preventive care / dentsply ) when applied at a dosage of 8 milligrams ( one tooth ) or 32 mg ( 8 mg on each of four teeth ) to 40 healthy adults . methods : the authors recruited 40 healthy subjects ( 18 men and 22 women , 20 - 55 years of age ) who did not have histories of pit and fissure sealant placement or composite resin restorations . the authors collected saliva ( 30 milliliters ) and blood ( 7 ml ) specimens from all subjects immediately before sealant placement ( baseline ) and at one hour , three hours , one day , three days and five days after sealant placement . they used high - pressure liquid chromatography to determine bpa ( detection sensitivity 5 parts per billion , or ppb ) in all specimens . results : the authors detected bpa in some saliva specimens ( 5 . 8 - 105 . 6 ppb ) collected at one hour and three hours . the bpa , however , was not detectable beyond three hours or in any of the serum specimens . for the one - and three - hour saliva samples , the bpa concentration in the high - dose ( 32 mg ) group was significantly greater than in the low - dose ( 8 mg ) group ( p < . 05 , wilcoxon signed rank test ). in the high - dose group , there was a significant decrease in saliva bpa concentrations from one hour to three hours ( p < . 01 , wilcoxon signed rank test ). conclusion : this study showed that bpa released orally from a dental sealant may not be absorbed or may be present in nondetectable amounts in systemic circulation . the concern about potential estrogenicity of sealant may be unfounded .	0
fracture properties of aged and post - processed dental composites .. the purpose of this study was to determine the flexure strength ( sigma f ), young ' s modulus ( e ), and fracture toughness ( kic ) of five dental composites after aging in water and air . the composites were , by weight , 75 % or 79 % glass filler and 25 % or 21 % resin composed of 60 % bis - gma and 40 % teg - dma . the filler was either strontium glass ( 75sr or 79sr ) or a combination , by weight , of 90 % strontium glass and 10 % colloidal silica ( 75sr10 or 79sr10 ). the specimens , 2 x 4 x 70 mm bars , were aged in either air or distilled water at 37 degrees c and were tested in their respective aging media at a loading rate of 1 . 22 mm / s . the sigma f and e were tested in four - point loading and the kic in three - point loading . the addition of the fillers to the unfilled resin resulted in a statistically significant increase in the flexure strength , flexure modulus , and fracture toughness . aging in air had minimal effect on these properties . however , testing and aging in water led to a significant decrease in the mechanical properties in the first 6 months , but had limited effect from 6 to 12 months .	0
characterization of endocrine disruptors from a complex matrix using estrogen receptor affinity columns and high performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry .. complex mixtures of contaminants with potential adverse effects on human health and wildlife are found in the environment and in the food chain . these mixtures include numerous anthropogenic compounds of various origins and structures , which may behave as endocrine disruptors . mixture ' s complexity is further enhanced by biotic and abiotic transformations . it is therefore necessary to develop new strategies allowing the identification of the structure of known , as well as unknown , nuclear receptor ( nr ) ligands present in complex matrices . we explored the possibility to use nr - based affinity columns to characterize the presence of bioactive molecules in environmental complex mixtures . estrogen receptor α ( erα )- based affinity columns were used to trap and purify estrogenic substances present in surface sediment samples collected in a french river under mixed anthropogenic pressure . we combined biological , biochemical and analytical approaches to characterize the structure of ligands retained on columns and demonstrate the presence of known active molecules such as bisphenol a and octylphenol , but also of unexpected erα ligands ( n - butylparaben , hydroxyl - methyl - benzofuranone ). high resolution mass spectrometry results demonstrate that erα affinity columns can be used for the isolation , purification and identification of known as well as unknown estrogenic contaminants present in complex matrices .	0
the long - term effectiveness of five current desensitizing products on cervical dentine sensitivity .. the aim of this study was to compare the long - term effectiveness of five desensitizing products on 25 male and 27 female patients ( total 52 ) aged 21 - 67 years ( mean 36 +/- 7 years ) suffering from cervical dentine sensitivity . all subjects were seen by the same examiner ( id ) who was blinded to the applied treatment for 3 - month clinical study . patients were asked to record their overall sensitivity by marking a point on a 10 cm visual analogue scale ( vas ). two hundred and seventy - seven sensitive teeth were treated by one of the five desensitizing products , all of which were placed following manufacturers ' instructions by the other investigator ( as ). a paired ( split mouth ) study design was used and selection of quadrants was randomized . at the post - treatment and at 10 days and 3 months periods , sensitivity measurements were recorded by the same investigator ( id ). statistical analysis showed that all of the vas scores at post - treatment evaluation points were significantly decreased compared with baseline data ( p < 0 . 05 ). there was a significant reduction in mean sensitivity scores in the protect liner f and the health - dent desensitizer groups when compared with fluoline varnish at the 10 - day time point ( p < 0 . 05 ). at 3 months , the protect liner f group continued to show a significantly reduced sensitivity level when compared with health - dent desensitizer , single bond , fluoline and gluma desensitizer ( p < 0 . 05 ). the present study demonstrated that although at the end of 3 - month evaluation period all desensitizers showed lower vas sensitivity values compared with baseline , there were differences in the level of reduction of cervical dentine sensitivity .	0
surface area of dental enamel , bone , and hydroxyapatite : chemisorption from solution .. the surface areas of three different samples of hydroxyapatite , samples of deproteinized bone , and samples of whole and deproteinized enamel were determined by adsorption of an adduct ( the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol a with n - phe - nylglycine ) from methylene chloride solution . in all cases , the surface areas of these samples agree well with those obtained by the bet ( n2 ) method .	0

effect of adhesives on the inhibition of secondary caries around compomer restorations .. this study evaluated the effect of adhesives on the inhibition of secondary caries around compomer restorations in vitro . two adhesive systems with a bis - gma resin , scotch bond multi - purpose ( mp ) and single bond ( sb ), and one adhesive system with no bis - gma resin , f2000 compomer primer / adhesive ( pa ), were used prior to placement of the compomer ( f2000 ), and non - fluoride releasing resin composite ( z100 ) was used as a control . class v cavities prepared on extracted human premolars were restored with various combinations of materials : f2000 / mp , f2000 / sb , f2000 / pa , z100 / mp , z100 / sb and z100 / pa . the restored teeth were incubated in bacterial medium containing sucrose with streptococcus mutans for two weeks after storage for 14 days . on microradiographs , the radio - opaque layers adjacent to the f2000 restorations were thick and clear , while the layers in the z100 restorations were unclear . in the f2000 restorations , the mean thickness of the radio - opaque layers in the pa group was significantly greater than that of the mp and sb groups . in fluoride - releasing measurement , f2000 coated with pa showed a significantly higher amount of fluoride release than mp and sb , and no significant difference in the amount of fluoride release from uncoated f2000 . these results indicated that applying an adhesive without bis - gma resin to compomer restoration has no suppressive effect on the fluoride release from compomer and might be beneficial for inhibiting secondary caries in vitro .	0
direct bonding of orthodontic brackets to porcelain veneer laminates .. the forces required to debond orthodontic attachments from porcelain veneer laminates were studied in vitro . brackets were bonded to 160 veneered bovine incisor teeth before the determination of the debond force . the independent variables studied were resin type , priming agent , porcelain surface preparation , and debonding time . the average debond forces were compared with those obtained by debonding brackets bonded to natural teeth by means of the acid - etch technique . the bond between the resin and the porcelain surface was found to be satisfactory for direct bonding of orthodontic attachments . roughening the porcelain surface and using a silane primer required an average debond force comparable to that of the acid - etched enamel bond at 24 hours . however , it increased the risk for porcelain fracture during debonding . roughened surfaces and surfaces with micro - fractures could be satisfactorily finished and polished with either a series of graded ceramiste points or a diamond - impregnated polishing wheel followed by a diamond polishing paste .	0
the activity of bisphenol a depends on both the estrogen receptor subtype and the cell type .. bisphenol a ( bpa ), a monomer of plastic used in consumer products , is abundant in the environment and enters the body by ingestion or adsorption . in order to characterize the estrogenic effect of bpa , we performed luciferase assay on three independent cell lines derived from different tissues transfected with either human eralpha cdna or erbeta cdna . the estrogenic activities of bpa were detectable in all cell lines via both eralpha and erbeta . in 293t cells and hec - 1 cells , the estrogenic activities were significantly decreased when cells expressing eralpha were incubated with 10 (- 6 ) m bpa in the presence of 10 (- 8 ) m 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) while the activities via erbeta were essentially unchanged in the same conditions . interestingly , no reduction of estrogenic activity was detected in hos - te85 cells via either eralpha or erbeta . our results indicate that bpa only acts as an agonist of estrogen via erbeta whereas it has dual actions as an agonist and antagonist in some types of cells via eralpha . thus , the activity of bpa may depend on the er subtype and the tissue involved .	0
relationship between nanoleakage and long - term durability of dentin bonds .. this study tested the hypothesis that long - term durability of resin bonds to dentin would directly relate to the nanoleakage of dentin bonding systems . twenty extracted third molars were ground flat with # 600 grit sic paper under running water to expose middle dentin . one - step or single bond was applied to the dentin surface according to the manufacturer ' s instruction . a crown was built - up with clearfil ap - x resin composite and the specimens were stored in water for 24 hours at 37 degrees c . the bonded assemblies were cut mesio - distally perpendicular to the interface in approximately 0 . 7 mm thick slabs and trimmed for microtensile bond strength testing . all slabs were immersed in individual bottles containing 37 degrees c water that was changed daily . specimens were randomly assigned to four groups ( one day , three , six and nine months ), and at the specified time period , the specimens to be tested were randomly divided into two subgroups for testing : 50 % agno3 and the control . in the 50 % agno3 subgroup , the slabs were coated with fingernail varnish except for approximately 0 . 5 mm around the bonded interface and immersed for one hour in 50 % agno3 , followed by exposure in a photo developing solution for 12 hours just prior to debonding . the specimens in the control subgroup were soaked in water until they were debonded . then , all specimens were subjected to microtensile bond testing . micrographs of the fractured surfaces of the debonded specimens in the agno3 subgroup were taken using light microscopy . they were then subjected to image analysis by nih image pc ( scion , fredrick , md , usa ), and the area of silver penetration was quantitated . the fractured surface was further analyzed under the sem . bond strength data and the silver penetration areas were subjected to two and three - way anova and fisher ' s plsd test at the 95 % level of confidence . regression analysis was used to test the relationship between bond strengths and the silver penetra tion area at each time period . the tensile bond strength of both materials gradually decreased over time . specimens bonded with one - step showed less silver nanoleakage at one day compared to three , six and nine months ( p < 0 . 05 ), but there were no significant differences between the nanoleakage measured at three , six and nine months . in contrast , for specimens bonded with single bond , there were no statistically significant differences in the silver nanoleakage among the four time periods tested ( p > 0 . 05 ). no correlation was observed between bond strength and nanoleakage for either bonding system . nanoleakage occurred in both adhesive systems , and bond strengths gradually decreased over time . however , there was no correlation between bond strength and nanoleakage for either adhesive system in this study .	0
sulfonation of environmental estrogens by zebrafish cytosolic sulfotransferases .. environmental estrogen - like chemicals are increasingly recognized as a potential hazardous factor for wildlife as well as humans . we have recently embarked on developing a zebrafish model for investigating the role of sulfonation in the metabolism and adverse functioning of environmental estrogens . here , we report on a systematic investigation of the sulfonation of representative environmental estrogens ( bisphenol a , 4 - n - octylphenol , 4 - n - nolylphenol , diethylstilbestrol , and 17 alpha - ethynylestradiol ) by zebrafish cytosolic sulfotransferases ( sts ). of the seven enzymes tested , four zebrafish sts ( designated zf st # 2 , zf st # 3 , zf st # 4 , and zf dhea st ) exhibited differential sulfonating activities toward the five environmental estrogens tested , with zf st # 3 being more highly active than the other three . it was further demonstrated that bisphenol a , 4 - n - octylphenol , and 4 - n - nonylphenol exerted concentration - dependent inhibition of the sulfonation of 17 beta - estradiol , implying a potential role of these environmental estrogens in interfering with the sulfonation , and possibly homeostasis , of endogenous estrogens . kinetic studies revealed that the mechanism underlying the inhibition by bisphenol a or 4 - n - nonylphenol to be of the competitive type .	0

a comparison of fluroshield with delton fissure sealant : four year results .. purpose : the purpose of this study was to evaluate the retention rate and the caries increment differences between a light cured , f releasing filled fissure sealant and a non - f nonfilled one . methods : the two different fissure sealants ( fluoroshield , delton ) were placed on all 4 caries - free first permanent molars of 112 children aged 7 - 8 years , under a half - mouth experimental design . all the children were seen in 6 month intervals where a preventive program , including regular topical fluoride application was applied . the sealants were not reapplied if they had been lost between examinations . results : after 48 months 162 teeth in the f sealant group and 162 in the conventional sealant group were evaluated . regarding sealant retention , 124 teeth ( 77 %) in the first group and 144 ( 89 %) in the second were fully sealed , and 23 ( 14 %) compared to 9 ( 6 %) were partly sealed ( p = 0 . 01 ). regarding caries development , 14 teeth ( 9 %) had developed caries in the first group and 19 ( 10 %) in the second ( p > 0 . 1 ). conclusion : in a regular biannual preventing program including topical gel application , f - releasing filled sealant ( fluroshield ) appears to have a declined full retention rate , after four years , when compared with a non - f nonfilled one ( delton ). however , total sealant loss and caries increment was similar in both groups .	0
strain specific induction of pyometra and differences in immune responsiveness in mice exposed to 17α - ethinyl estradiol or the endocrine disrupting chemical bisphenol a .. pyometra is an inflammatory disease of the uterus that can be caused by chronic exposure to estrogens . it is unknown whether weakly estrogenic endocrine disruptors can cause pyometra . we investigated whether dietary exposures to the estrogenic endocrine disruptor bisphenol a ( bpa ) induced pyometra . pyometra did not occur in cd1 mice exposed to different dietary doses of bpa ranging from 4 . 1 to > 4000μg / kg - d or 17α - ethinyl estradiol ( ee ; 1 . 2 to > 150μg / kg - d ). in the c57bl / 6 strain , pyometra occurred in the 15μg / kg - d ee and 33μg / kg - d bpa treatment groups . at the effective concentration of bpa , histological analysis revealed pathological alterations of uterine morphology associated with a > 5 . 3 - fold increase in macrophage numbers in non - pyometra uteri of c57bl / 6 mice exposed to bpa . these results suggest that bpa enhances immune responsiveness of the uterus and that heightened responsiveness in c57bl / 6 females is related to increased susceptibility to pyometra .	0
do contaminants originating from state - of - the - art treated wastewater impact the ecological quality of surface waters ?. since the 1980s , advances in wastewater treatment technology have led to considerably improved surface water quality in the urban areas of many high income countries . however , trace concentrations of organic wastewater - associated contaminants may still pose a key environmental hazard impairing the ecological quality of surface waters . to identify key impact factors , we analyzed the effects of a wide range of anthropogenic and environmental variables on the aquatic macroinvertebrate community . we assessed ecological water quality at 26 sampling sites in four urban german lowland river systems with a 0 - 100 % load of state - of - the - art biological activated sludge treated wastewater . the chemical analysis suite comprised 12 organic contaminants ( five phosphor organic flame retardants , two musk fragrances , bisphenol a , nonylphenol , octylphenol , diethyltoluamide , terbutryn ), 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , and 12 heavy metals . non - metric multidimensional scaling identified organic contaminants that are mainly wastewater - associated ( i . e ., phosphor organic flame retardants , musk fragrances , and diethyltoluamide ) as a major impact variable on macroinvertebrate species composition . the structural degradation of streams was also identified as a significant factor . multiple linear regression models revealed a significant impact of organic contaminants on invertebrate populations , in particular on ephemeroptera , plecoptera , and trichoptera species . spearman rank correlation analyses confirmed wastewater - associated organic contaminants as the most significant variable negatively impacting the biodiversity of sensitive macroinvertebrate species . in addition to increased aquatic pollution with organic contaminants , a greater wastewater fraction was accompanied by a slight decrease in oxygen concentration and an increase in salinity . this study highlights the importance of reducing the wastewater - associated impact on surface waters . for aquatic ecosystems in urban areas this would lead to : ( i ) improvement of the ecological integrity , ( ii ) reduction of biodiversity loss , and ( iii ) faster achievement of objectives of legislative requirements , e . g ., the european water framework directive .	0
color stability of ten resin - based restorative materials .. unlabelled : despite significant developments to improve the optical properties of composites , color stability remains a challenge with changes still observed immediately after polymerization and after some time of storage . objective : this study aimed to evaluate the color change of ten commercially available resin composite systems immediately after polymerization , at 24 hours , and at 1 month of water storage . materials and methods : five discs of two thicknesses ( 1 mm / 3 mm ) in two shades ( a3 / bleach ) were made from ten commercially available brands of resin composite . color measurements were recorded with a colorimeter and expressed in terms of the cie l * a * b * scale . color change was calculated between baseline and immediate polymerization ( δe *( 1 ) ), between immediate polymerization and 24 hours ( δe *( 2 ) ), and between 24 hours and 1 month ( δe *( 3 ) ). values δe * ≥ 3 . 3 were considered clinically unacceptable as color shifts over this threshold value may be noticeable . the results were analyzed using a three - way analysis of variance ( anova ) and student - newman - keuls ' s tests . a significance level of 0 . 05 was used for all tests . results : color change was evidenced for all brands , shades , and thickness . the greatest color change was observed immediately after initial polymerization with δe * values ranging from 2 . 4 to 12 . 0 . color change after 24 hours and 1 month were significantly less than those observed after polymerization . immediately after polymerization , only tetric evoceram ( ivoclar - vivadent , amherst , ny , usa ) showed changes below 3 . 3 . at 24 hours , 20 out of the 40 groups including all materials in both shades and thicknesses showed changes above 3 . 3 . at 1 month , color changes for all brands remained under 3 . 3 . conclusions : overall , clinically relevant color changes ( δe * ≥ 3 . 3 ) took place immediately after polymerization of current light - activated composites . these changes were predominantly attributed to shifts in the l * and b * parameters towards the dark and blue region , respectively . color shifts continued at 24 hours with changes in the l * and b * parameters towards the light and yellow region , respectively . after 1 month , only minor changes under the 3 . 3 threshold took place . clinical significance : ensuring an accurate color match of resin composite restorations to the surrounding tooth structure is a critical aspect of any esthetic restorative procedure . a better understanding of the changes taking place during the different stages of maturation and storage of composites may be of significant benefit to clinicians as this may help minimize shade mismatch issues .	0

caries - preventive effect of fissure sealant containing surface reaction - type pre - reacted glass ionomer filler and bonded by self - etching primer .. objective : we aimed to evaluate the caries - preventive effect of a fissure sealant containing surface reaction - type pre - reacted glass ionomer ( s - prg ) filler and bonded by self - etching primer versus those of 2 conventional resin - based sealants bonded by acid etching in terms of its impact on enamel demineralization and remineralization , enamel bond strength , and integrity of debonded enamel surfaces . materials and method : demineralization , remineralization , and bond strength on untreated enamel and enamel subsurface lesions of bovine incisors were assessed among the sealants by polarizing microscopy and microradiography ; debonded enamel surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy . results : the conventional resin - based sealants bonded by acid etching caused surface defects on the enamel subsurface lesions and significantly increased the lesion depth ( p = 0 . 014 ), indicative of enamel demineralization . however the s - prg filler - containing sealant bonded by self - etching primer maintained the enamel surface integrity and inhibited enamel demineralization . no difference in bond strength on both untreated enamel and enamel subsurface lesions was noted among the sealants . conclusions : an s - prg filler - containing fissure sealant bonded by self - etching primer can prevent enamel demineralization , microleakage , and gaps without the tags created by acid etching regardless of the enamel condition . such sealants are suitable for protecting the pits and fissures of immature permanent teeth .	0
influence of adhesive systems on interfacial dentin gap formation in vitro .. purpose : this study measured : 1 ) the interfacial dentin gap formation ( igw ) of 2 etch & rinse and 3 self - etch systems with different degrees of acidity and determined the correlation between the smear layer thickness and interfacial gap formation after 1 day and 6 months water storage ; 2 ) the hybrid layer thickness ( hlt ) produced by the adhesives applied under different smear layer thicknesses . methods and materials : three self - etch adhesives , a mild ( clearfil se bond ; se ), a moderate ( optibond solo plus self - etch primer ; so ) and a strong ( tyrian self priming etchant + one step plus ; ty ), and 2 etch & rinse systems ( single bond ; sb and scotchbond multi - purpose plus ; sbmp ) were studied . after flat grinding of the occlusal surfaces , 30 molars were sectioned longitudinally in 2 halves . dentin surfaces with thick and thin smear layers were obtained for each tooth after polishing different sections on 60 - and 600 - grit sic paper , respectively . a resin composite ( z250 ) build - up was made on each tooth section after randomized application of the adhesives . after 24 - hour storage in water , resin - dentin bonded sticks ( 0 . 8 mm2 ) were prepared and divided for 1 - day and 6 - month measurements . the igw was measured in a stereomicroscope under 400x . sem micrographs were also made in order to measure the hlt provided by each adhesive . results : the thickness of the smear layer did not influence the mean gap width ( p > 0 . 05 ). the etch & rinse systems showed the lowest mean igw in the 1 - day group . their igw remained unchanged after 6 months . the self - etch systems showed wider initial igw , which diminished after 6 months water storage , to sizes similar to the etch & rinse systems . the hybrid layer was thicker when bonded to # 60 sic - treated dentin ; however , this difference was only statistically different for the 3 - step etch & rinse system ( p = 0 . 001 ). the thickest hybrid layers were observed for the 2 etch & rinse adhesive systems and the thinnest for the mild self - etch . a negative and strong correlation between igw and hlt was observed for the self - etching adhesive systems tested ( r = 80 . 2 , p = 0 . 01 ).	0
7 . 87 ev laser desorption postionization mass spectrometry of adsorbed and covalently bound bisphenol a diglycidyl methacrylate .. bisphenol a diglycidyl methacrylate ( bis - gma ) was adsorbed onto or covalently bound to a porous silicon oxide surface . laser desorption 10 . 5 ev postionization mass spectrometry ( ldpi - ms ) was previously demonstrated for surface analysis of adsorbed and surface bound bis - gma , but signal to noise levels were low and ion fragmentation was extensive . 7 . 87 ev postionization using the fluorine laser was demonstrated here for bis - gma . however , signal levels remained low for ldpi - ms of bis - gma as its ionization potential ( ip ) was only approximately 7 . 8 ev , near threshold for single photon ionization by the 7 . 87 ev fluorine laser . it is known that aromatic tagging of molecular analytes can lower the overall ip of the tagged molecular complex , allowing 7 . 87 ev single photon ionization . therefore , bis - gma was also derivatized with several tags whose ips were either below or above 7 . 87 ev : the tag with an ip below 7 . 87 ev enhanced single photon ionization while the tags with higher ips did not . however , signal intensities were enhanced by resonant laser desorption for two of the derivatized bis - gmas . intact ions of bis - gma and its derivatives were generally observed by 7 . 87 ev ldpi - ms , consistent with the formation of ions with relatively little internal energy upon threshold single photon ionization .	0
clinical evaluation of a one - bottle bonding system for desensitizing exposed roots .. purpose : to evaluate the effectiveness of a one - bottle adhesive system as a desensitizing treatment , with or without a prior phosphoric acid - etch step . materials and methods : two different clinical procedures using a one - bottle adhesive bonding system were tested for its efficacy on desensitizing exposed roots . thirty subjects with a history of dentin hypersensitivity were selected and 60 exposed sensitive teeth were divided into two groups ( n = 30 ). in group 1 samples , scotchbond 1 bonding system ( single bond in usa ) was applied without a prior acid - etching , while in those of group 2 , the exposed sensitive roots were acid - etched with 35 % phosphoric acid for 15 seconds , prior to application of bonding agents . the sensitivity was evaluated at 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 weeks and 3 months using cold air blast stimuli , and recorded using a visual - analogue scale . the scores were analyzed as non - parametric data by means of the mann - whitney and sign tests . five samples from each group were randomly selected in order to make scanning electron microscope observations of the sensitive dentin surfaces at baseline and at each recall using the replica technique . results : at baseline , after both desensitizing procedures all the patients reported distinct reductions in dentin sensitivity . at 1 - and 2 - week recalls , 20 teeth of group 1 and 17 teeth in group 2 exhibited a return of sensitivity , and in five teeth in each group , the sensitivity score was between 5 - 8 . during the first recall ( 1 - 2 weeks ), the sensitive teeth were retreated and showed an immediate reduction of sensitivity . at the 1 - month recall , eight teeth in group 1 and four teeth in group 2 showed a return of some sensitivity , and in six teeth in group 1 and in three teeth in group 2 , old amalgam restorations were replaced and this procedure almost completely resolved the sensitivity . at the 3 - month recall , only five teeth from each group showed residual mild sensitivity ( score 1 - 2 ). for both groups 1 and 2 there was a statistically significant ( p < 0 . 0005 ) reduction in sensitivity levels between the baseline pain scores and immediately after treatment , and between the first recall pre - treatment pain scores and the last recall pain scores . overall , the two methods of treatment demonstrated a general decrease in sensitivity in both groups over the 3 - month study period , adequately solving the clinical and patients ' perception of the discomfort of sensitivity . the sem observations of the replicas showed a progressive loss of the adhesive resin from the treated surfaces . this fact was more evident in the non - etched samples ( group 2 ) than in those in group 1 . the results of this study showed that exposed root dentin sealed with scotchbond 1 , with or without prior acid - etching , did not show spontaneous sensitivity after 3 months .	0
in vitro peel / shear bond strength evaluation of orthodontic bracket base design .. objectives : the adhesive capacity of 17 different bracket types was evaluated in an in vitro peel / shear test . methods : silane - treated metal bars were used as substrates with all bonding being performed using the orthodontic adhesive concise . the effect of aluminium oxide air abrasion on the bonding performance of recycled metal bracket bases was evaluated . morphological examination of the bracket bases was carried out under scanning electron microscopy . statistics analysis included one - way anova with tukey ' s studentized range test , two - way anova and weibull analysis . results : mean peel / shear bond strength values range from 13 . 9 mpa for allure accu arch , a ceramic bracket type , to 1 . 6 mpa for the plastic bracket ceramaflex advant edge . allure accu arch performed the best of all the ceramic brackets . however , bracket wing fracture was observed . the metal brackets mini masters and omni arch showed no significant difference in bond strength compared with the ceramic bracket allure accu arch ( p < 0 . 01 ). conclusion : the type of the bracket base determines its adhesive capacity . sandblasting the base of recycled metal brackets had no uniform effect .	0
assessment of decontamination methods as pretreatment of silanization of composite glass fillers .. in terms of mechanical properties and durability , the surface of glass fillers should be decontaminated in order to optimize the silanization process for the production of resin composites . the objective of this study was to evaluate the decontamination efficiency of 18 cleaning methods on glass fillers as pretreatment of silane coupling . x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that sio ( 2 ) boiled with a 5 % sodium peroxodisulfate aqueous solution for 15 min , followed by ultrasonic rinsing with acetone for 30 min was most effective among all the decontamination methods investigated . in addition , nano - indentation measurements on sio ( 2 ) treated by the above - mentioned method revealed that the surface was not significantly weakened as compared to untreated sio ( 2 ). the results of this study should lead to an improved filler - matrix coupling and thus contribute to the development of better wear and fatigue - resistant composites . therefore , sodium peroxodisulfate is proposed as a presilanization filler decontamination step in the production process of resin composites .	0

disruption of rapid , nongenomic steroid actions by environmental chemicals : interference with progestin stimulation of sperm motility in atlantic croaker .. several nongenomic steroid actions , like genomic ones , can be disrupted by estrogenic xenobiotics ( xenoestrogens ), but the extent and sensitivity of this alternative mechanism of steroid action to chemical interference remain unclear . the effects of environmentally realistic concentrations of a broad range of organic contaminants on the nongenomic action of a progestin ( 17 , 20beta , 21 - trihydroxy - 4 - pregnen - 3 - one or 20beta - s ) to upregulate atlantic croaker sperm motility were examined in an in vitro bioassay . pretreatment of sperm for 10 min in vitro with estrogenic compounds ( estradiol - 17beta , o , p '- ddt derivatives , zearalenone , bisphenol a , 2 ', 3 ', 4 ', 5 '- pcb - 4 - oh , kepone , chlordane , methoxyclor ) and nonestrogenic organic compounds ( p , p '- ddt derivatives , atrazine , aroclor 1254 , naphthalene , benzene ) at concentrations ranging from 0 . 01 to 10 microm did not decrease the percent of motile sperm , but all of them partially or completely blocked the response to 20beta - s . most of the compounds impaired this endocrine mechanism at a concentration of 0 . 1 microm ( approximately 30 - 40ppb ), whereas o , p '- ddt and atrazine were effective at lower concentrations . the antagonistic actions of o , p '- ddt were partially reversed with 10 - fold higher concentrations of 20beta - s , which is consistent with a hormone receptor - mediated mechanism of ddt action . the finding that low concentrations of a wide range of organic environmental contaminants can interfere with a rapid , nongenomic steroid action suggests that this mechanism of endocrine disturbance is of toxicological importance .	0
saliva contamination and resin micromorphological adaptation to cavity walls using single - bottle adhesives .. purpose : to examine and compare the effect of saliva contamination on the resin micromorphologic adaptation of four single - bottle adhesives . materials and methods : prime & bond 2 . 1 , one - step , tenure quik with fluoride and syntac single component adhesives were evaluated . sixty sound molars were divided into three subgroups for each of the four adhesives ; class v cavities were prepared with gingival margins at cementum . each adhesive was tested under : normal conditions ( group 1 ), contamination of the cavity with fresh whole saliva for 20 seconds and removing the excess ( group 2 ), and contamination of the cavity with fresh whole saliva for 20 seconds and rinsing the saliva for 20 seconds before adhesive application ( group 3 ). after curing the adhesive , the cavities were filled with z100 composite , fixed in 2 . 0 % glutaraldehyde and sectioned into two halves . the sectioned halves were fixed again and rinsed with 0 . 2 m sodium cacodylate buffer . the cut surfaces were wet ground , polished and sonicated in distilled water . the specimens were immersed in decalcifying solution , deprotenized , serially dehydrated , mounted on aluminum stubs , sputter coated and examined under the sem . results : the four adhesives formed hybrid layer with resin tags penetration into the dentin . p & b 2 . 1 showed usually funnel - shaped resin tags ; one - step , cylindrical shape ; tenure quick and syntac sc , variable shapes . saliva contamination did not prevent hybrid layer formation or resin penetration into the dentin tubules . only syntac sc displayed a relatively thin hybrid layer with the unwashed saliva - contaminated group .	0
deviation from additivity with estrogenic mixtures containing 4 - nonylphenol and 4 - tert - octylphenol detected in the e - screen assay .. an intriguing deviation from expected additivity is reported with mixtures containing 17beta - estradiol , 17alpha - ethinylestradiol , genistein , bisphenol a , 4 - nonylphenol , and 4 - tert - octylphenol . the effect of these chemicals on the proliferation of estrogen - dependent mcf - 7 human breast cancer cells ( the e - screen ) was measured . data variance - component analyses , carried out to optimize the assay for mixture studies , showed that between - experiment variability was the dominant source of data variation . adoption of a data - normalization procedure reduced the impact of this variability and allowed the pooling of historical e - screen data . concentration - response relationships for all six chemicals were recorded and utilized to calculate predictions of their joint effects by employing the model of concentration addition . surprisingly , the observed combination effects of the mixture fell short of the additivity expectations , indicating weak antagonism . experimental or prediction errors were ruled out as possible explanations for this deviation , which suggested that it might be the result of interactions between mixture components . with the aim of identifying the responsible components , mixtures were designed by excluding one or more of the chemicals from the original six - component mixture , and the resulting combination effects were assessed . these permutation studies allowed us to conclude thatthe presence of 4 - nonylphenol and 4 - tert - octylphenol is associated with the antagonisms observed with the six - component mixture and thus negatively affected the predictability of mixture effects . future mixture studies utilizing the e - screen with endocrine disrupters that also exhibit toxicity or growth - inhibitory effects will have to take account of the possibility that such interactions might compromise the predictability of estrogenic combination effects .	0
shear bond strength of hydrophilic adhesive systems to enamel .. purpose : to compare the enamel shear bond strength of four hydrophilic adhesive systems : one multiple - bottle ( scotchbond multi - purpose plus ), two one - bottle ( stae , single bond ) and one self - etching ( etch & prime ). materials and methods : 120 bovine incisor teeth were obtained , embedded in polyester resin , polished to 600 grit to form standardized enamel surfaces , and randomly assigned to four groups ( n = 30 ). each adhesive system was used on enamel according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , and resin - based composite ( z100 ) cylinders with 3 mm diameter and 5 mm height were bonded . specimens were stored in humid environment for 1 week , and bond strength was determined using a universal testing machine , at a crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / minute . results : the mean shear bond strength values ( mpa +/- sd ) were : single bond : 24 . 28 +/- 5 . 27 ( a ); scotchbond multi - purpose plus : 21 . 18 +/- 4 . 35 ( ab ); stae : 19 . 56 +/- 4 . 71 ( b ); etch & prime 3 . 0 : 15 . 13 +/- 4 . 92 ( c ). anova revealed significant difference in means ( p < 0 . 01 ) and tukey ' s test showed the statistical differences that are expressed by different letters for each group . it could be concluded that the self - etching adhesive system did not provide as good a bond to enamel surface , as did the one - and multiple - bottle systems .	0
in vitro measurement of cuspal strain and displacement in composite restored teeth .. objectives : this study was carried out to measure changes in cuspal strain and displacement occurring during placement and polymerization of bonded composite restorations in extracted human teeth in vitro . methods : strains were measured using electrical resistance strain gauges bonded to the buccal and lingual cusps of each specimen and cuspal displacement was recorded with a linear variable differential transformer . mesio - occluso - distal cavities of two types were prepared in lower molar teeth . following enamel acid etching and application of a dentine adhesion promoter , specimens were restored incrementally with a light curing posterior composite material . results : it was shown that the shrinkage of a composite material during polymerization generated stresses which resulted in tensile strains on the tooth surface . strains of up to 882 microns / m were recorded and a maximum cusp displacement of 14 microns was also measured . these strains were reduced but not eliminated by preparation and restoration a mesio - distal slot running the full length and depth of the restoration . statistical analysis revealed significantly higher strains and displacement produced on the buccal cusps of teeth that had a reduced cusp width ( p < 0 . 001 ). conclusions : the in vitro restoration of posterior teeth with a bonded composite material generates polymerization stresses which can be recorded as tensile strains and displacements on the tooth surface . strains measured during composite placement were greater when the remaining cusp width was less . a stress relief procedure resulted in a decrease in cuspal strain and displacement of approximately 30 - 40 %.	0
effect of dentine depth on the fracture toughness of dentine - composite adhesive interfaces .. objectives : the fracture toughness test was recently introduced as a clinically relevant method for assessing the fracture resistance of the dentine - composite interface . the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dentine depth on the interfacial fracture toughness test of several dentine - composite interfaces using some new proprietary dentine bonding agents . methods : miniature short rod fracture toughness specimens containing a chevron - shaped dentine - composite - bonded interface were prepared for each group ( n = 12 ). six different dentine bonding agents and two dentine depths were the variables assessed at the dentine - composite interfaces . after 24 h at 37 degrees c in water , the specimens were tested by loading at 0 . 5 mm / min in the instron universal testing machine . the interfacial kic results were analysed by anova , unpaired student ' s t - tests and fisher ' s lsd test ( p < 0 . 05 ). results : the interfacial kic results in mn . m - 3 / 2 ( s . d .) on superficial and deep dentine , respectively , were : all - bond 2 , 0 . 80 ( 0 . 21 ), 0 . 44 ( 0 . 13 ); bond - lt , 0 . 75 ( 0 . 20 ), 0 . 38 ( 0 . 19 ); prime and bond , 0 . 56 ( 0 . 11 ), 0 . 28 ( 0 . 10 ); scotchbond multi - purpose , 0 . 45 ( 0 . 23 ), 0 . 26 ( 0 . 15 ); one - step and optibond , insufficient results due to premature specimen failures . conclusions : the results from this study should contribute to the development of the fracture toughness test as a method for assessing the integrity of the dentine - composite interface . the interfacial fracture toughness test determined significant differences among the different dentine bonding agents and between the superficial and deep dentine substrates . the dentine bonding agents showed significantly reduced interfacial fracture toughness results when bonding to deep versus superficial dentine .	0
prenatal and neonatal exposure to low - dose of bisphenol - a enhance the morphine - induced hyperlocomotion and rewarding effect .. bisphenol - a has been extensively evaluated for toxicity in a variety of tests as the most common environmental endocrine disruptors . in the previous study , we reported that prenatal and neonatal exposure to high - dose of bisphenol - a affects the development of central dopaminergic system in the mouse limbic area . the present study was then undertaken to investigate whether prenatal and neonatal exposure to lower dose of bisphenol - a could change the morphine - induced several pharmacological actions such as rewarding effect and hyperlocomotion in mice . prenatal and neonatal exposure to low - dose of bisphenol - a enhanced the morphine - induced hyperlocomotion and rewarding effect . additionally , the treatment with bisphenol - a produced an up - regulation of dopamine receptor function to activate g - protein in the mouse limbic forebrain , which is thought to play a critical role for hyperlocomotion and rewarding effects by drugs of abuse . these findings suggest that prenatal and neonatal exposure to low - dose of bisphenol - a can potentiate the central dopamine receptor - dependent neurotransmission , resulting in the supersensitivity of the morphine - induced hyperlocomotion and rewarding effects in the mouse .	0
effect of refrigeration on shear bond strength of three dentin bonding systems .. purpose : to determine whether use of dentin bonding agents directly from refrigerated storage would have adverse effects on their shear bond strength to dentin . materials and methods : resin - based composite cylinders were bonded to dentin on the ground occlusal surfaces of 60 extracted human molars using three different dentin bonding systems at 3 . 0 degrees c and 23 . 5 degrees c . the cylinders were then debonded using an instron testing machine in compression mode at 0 . 5 mm / sec . the results were interpreted with t - test and student - newman - keuls post hoc analysis . results : scotchbond multi - purpose demonstrated significantly lower shear bond strengths at 23 . 5 degrees c ( p < 0 . 05 ) than all other groups at both 3 . 0 degrees c and 23 . 5 degrees c . all - bond 2 and prime & bond had higher shear bond strengths at refrigerated temperature , but the differences were insignificant in magnitude .	0
potential exposure to bisphenol a from food - contact use of polycarbonate resins .. the potential exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) from the use of consumer products or packages made from bisphenol a - derived polycarbonate resins was calculated . the calculation was made on the basis of migration data from moulded discs prepared from a composite of polycarbonate resins . the data were obtained using the customary experimental procedures developed by the united states food and drug administration ( fda ). the potential migration of bpa to food from its contact with articles made from polycarbonate resins was determined using food - simulating solvents and time and temperature conditions recommended by fda . the study demonstrates that no detectable bpa was found in the extracts obtained under fda ' s most severe default testing condition using a method sensitive to 5 parts per billion ( ppb ) in the food simulants . using these data , along with fda ' s conventional procedure for estimating potential dietary exposure using food simulating migration data , the potential dietary exposure to bisphenol a from use of polycarbonate resins was determined to be less than 0 . 25 ppb .	0
analysis of trace organic contaminants in sediment , pore water , and water samples from onsan bay , korea : instrumental analysis and in vitro gene expression assay .. persistent organic pollutants and alkylphenols ( aps ) were determined in sediment and water samples from onsan bay , korea , by using instrumental analysis and in vitro gene expression cell bioassay . polycyclic aromatic hydrocabons ( pahs ) were the predominant compounds in sediments with concentrations as great as 573 ng / g dry weight . the pah concentrations were elevated in sediment from inland rivers that flow through onsan city ( mean : 116 ng / g dry wt ) and discharge into onsan bay . concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) in sediments ranged from < 1 . 00 to 56 . 2 ng / g dry weight . among different organochlorine ( oc ) pesticides analyzed ( hexachlorobenzene , hexachlorocyclohexanes , chlordanes , and ddts ), ddt concentrations were the greatest , ranging from < 0 . 01 to 7 . 58 ng / g dry weight . the spatial gradient of contaminant concentrations suggested that streams and rivers are the major sources of pcbs , pahs , and aps to the bay . maximum concentrations of nonylphenol , octylphenol , and bisphenol a in sediments were 860 , 11 , and 204 ng / g dry weight , respectively . screening of onsan bay sediment samples for dioxinlike activity with the h4iie - luc in vitro cell bioassay revealed that 17 of 22 samples contained significant dioxinlike activity . further fractionation of sediment extracts indicated that mid - polar and more polar fractions were responsible for the significant dioxinlike activity . based on a mass balance analysis , pahs apparently accounted for only a small portion of dioxinlike responses elicited by sediment extracts . only one raw extract of sediment elicited a significant estrogenic response by mvln cells . the combination of instrumental analysis and in vitro bioassay was useful to assess sediment quality and characterize the causative agents or potential toxic compounds present .	0

effect of surface treatment on shear bond strength of zirconia to human dentin .. purpose : the effect of surface treatment using tribochemical silica coating / silane coupling on the shear bond strengths of ( 1 ) a glass - infiltrated , zirconia - reinforced alumina ( in - ceram zirconia ) and ( 2 ) a yttria - stabilized zirconia ceramic ( yz zirconia ) to human dentin was studied . materials and methods : twelve specimens of each ceramic were randomly assigned to one of three surface treatments : ( 1 ) no surface treatment ( control group ); ( 2 ) a chairside tribochemical silica coating / silane coupling system ( cojet group ); and ( 3 ) a laboratory tribochemical silica coating / silane coupling system ( rocatac group ). the mode of failure of each specimen was determined under magnification . results : the shear bond strengths ( mean ± sd ) of in - ceram zirconia of the control , cojet and rocatec groups were 5 . 7 ± 4 . 3 mpa , 11 . 4 ± 5 . 4 mpa , and 6 . 5 ± 4 . 8 mpa , respectively . the corresponding figures for yz zirconia were 8 . 2 ± 5 . 4 mpa , 9 . 8 ± 5 . 4 mpa , and 7 . 8 ± 4 . 7 mpa . two - way anova revealed significant differences in bond strength due to the difference in surface treatment ( p = 0 . 02 ), but the bond strengths between the two ceramics were not significantly different ( p = 0 . 56 ). post hoc tests showed that in - ceram zirconia treated with cojet had significantly higher shear bond strengths than those untreated ( p < 0 . 05 ) or treated with rocatec ( p < 0 . 05 ). surface treatment did not affect the shear bond strength of yz zirconia significantly ( p > 0 . 05 ). conclusion : the bonding of in - ceram zirconia can be improved by the chairside surface treatment system .	0
in - vitro microleakage of repaired fissure sealants : a randomized , controlled trial .. unlabelled : the aim of this study was to investigate whether differences in surface treatment prior to repair influenced the seal of a resin fissure sealant placed on the occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth . setting : in - vitro study . sample and methods : one hundred and twenty - eight extracted human first and second molars were randomly allocated to one of four groups of 32 teeth each . a light cured , unfilled , opaque resin fissure sealant ( delton ) was placed on their occlusal surface following cleaning by prophylaxis and acid etching . following storage in artificial saliva ( saliva orthana ) for a week , duplication of sealant failure was carried out . the teeth were then subjected to one of four different surface treatments : group 1 : with a slow - speed prophylaxis brush followed by acid etching ( control method ); group 2 : a slow - speed bur and acid etching ; group 3 : air abrasion and acid etching ; and group 4 : acid etching and application of a bonding agent . following a further week of storage in artificial saliva two layers of impermeable varnish were applied to the nonocclusal surfaces of the teeth ; their apices were then sealed with wax and the teeth were immersed in 1 % methylene blue for 48 h . the teeth were then sectioned ( isomet 1000 ) to achieve three cuts resulting in a maximum of four blocks , i . e . six surfaces per tooth . a total of 715 sections from 126 teeth were scored for microleakage on the intact and repaired side of the fissure sealant . results : statistical analysis did not demonstrate any one single method of repair to be superior to the control method for reapplication of the sealant . conclusion : all four techniques compared in this study seem to be acceptable for replacing or repairing lost or fractured fissure sealants . as prophylaxis with a brush rotating at slow speed followed by acid etching , which probably represents current practice , is also the simplest technique that can be practised on children , it is therefore recommended .	0
organic and metallic pollutants in water treatment and natural wetlands : a review .. a literature review shows that more than 500 compounds occur in wetlands , and also that wetlands are suitable for removing these compounds . there are , however , obvious pitfalls for treatment wetlands , the most important being the maintenance of the hydraulic capacity and the detention time . treatment wetlands should have an adapted design to target specific compounds . aquatic plants and soils are suitable for wastewater treatment with a high capacity of removing nutrients and other substances through uptake , sorption and microbiological degradation . the heavy metals cd , cu , fe , ni and pb were found to exceed limit values . the studies revealed high values of phenol and so ( 4 ). no samples showed concentrations in sediments exceeding limit values , but fish samples showed concentrations of hg exceeding the limit for fish sold in the european union ( eu ). the main route of metal uptake in aquatic plants was through the roots in emergent and surface floating plants , whereas in submerged plants roots and leaves take part in removing heavy metals and nutrients . submerged rooted plants have metal uptake potential from water as well as sediments , whereas rootless plants extracted metals rapidly only from water . caution is needed about the use of ssf cws ( subsurface flow constructed wetlands ) for the treatment of metal - contaminated industrial wastewater as metals are shifted to another environmental compartment , and stable redox conditions are required to ensure long - term efficiency . mercury is one of the most toxic heavy metals and wetlands have been shown to be a source of methylmercury . methyl hg concentrations are typically approximately 15 % of hgt ( total mercury ). in wetlands polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ), bisphenol a , btex , hydrocarbons including diesel range organics , glycol , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( ddt ), polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcb ), cyanide , benzene , chlorophenols and formaldehyde were found to exceed limit values . in sediments only pah and pcb were found exceeding limit values . the pesticides found above limit values were atrazine , simazine , terbutylazine , metolachlor , mecoprop , endosulfan , chlorfenvinphos and diuron . there are few water quality limit values of these compounds , except for some well - known endocrine disrupters such as nonylphenol , phtalates , etc .	0
biological validation of a sample preparation method for er - calux bioanalysis of estrogenic activity in sediment using mixtures of xeno - estrogens .. the combined estrogenic effects of mixtures of environmental pollutants in the in vitro er - calux ( chemical activated luciferase gene expression ) bioassaywere examined to biologically validate a sample preparation method for the analysis of estrogenic compounds in sediment . the method used accelerated solvent extraction ( ase ) and gel permeation chromatography ( gpc ) and was validated with respect to recovery of biological response taking mixture effects into account . four mixtures of three to six xenoestrogenic compounds ( bisphenol a , 4 - nonylphenol , ( 4 , 4 '- dichlorodiphenyl ) trichloroethane , ( 2 , 4 '- dichlorodiphenyl ) trichloroethane , dieldrin , 4 - n - octylphenol , alpha - chlordane , dibutylphthalate , ( 4 , 4 '- dichlorodiphenyl ) dichloroethylene , and 2 , 4 , 5 - trichlorobiphenyl ) were prepared . experimentally determined mixture effects were well described by the concept of concentration addition ( ca ), as expected for similarly acting compounds . observed estradiol equivalence factors of the mixtures ( on average 1 . 2 +/- 0 . 3 ) agreed very well with the value predicted according to ca . the sample preparation method was then applied to pure mixtures of standards and to sediment spiked with one of the mixtures . recoveries of estrogenic compounds were estimated by determination of their mixture potencies in er - calux and compared to the mixture effects predicted by ca . recoveries of estrogenic activity were between 80 and 129 %, indicating that the additive behavior of mixtures of xeno - estrogens is well conserved during sample preparation . together with an average repeatability of 18 . 3 %, low average limit of detection ( 2 . 6 +/- 1 . 8 pg of eeq / g ), and coefficient of variance ( 3 . 5 +/- 3 . 3 %), this demonstrated the suitability of the sample preparation method for the analysis of mixtures of ( xeno -) estrogenic compounds in sediment with the er - calux assay .	0
biotransformation of chlorpropham ( cipc ) in isolated rat hepatocytes and xenoestrogenic activity of cipc and its metabolites by in vitro assays .. 1 : the metabolism and action of chlorpropham ( isopropyl n -( 3 - chlorophenyl ) carbamate ; cipc , a post - harvest agent ) were studied in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes , and the oestrogen - like activity of cipc and its metabolites was assessed by in vitro assays . the exposure of hepatocyte suspensions to cipc caused concentration - ( 0 . 25 - 1 . 0 mm ) and time - ( 0 - 3 h ) dependent cell death , which was assessed by trypan blue exclusion , accompanied by losses of cellular adenosine triphosphate and adenine nucleotide pools , and formation of cell bleb . 2 : cipc at a weakly toxic level ( 0 . 25 or 0 . 5 mm ) was metabolized to isopropyl n -( 3 - chloro - 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) carbamate ( 4oh - cipc ) and subsequently to its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates ( major metabolites ) or alternatively to the minor metabolites 3 - chloroaniline ( 3ca ) and 3 - chloroacetanilide . cipc ( 0 . 25 mm ) added to hepatocyte suspensions was distributed equally between hepatocytes and the extracellular medium during the incubation . the glucuronide rather than the sulfate conjugate of 4oh - cipc predominantly increased in the medium with time , while the amount of unconjugated free 4oh - cipc in the extracellular medium increased by approximately threefold compared with the amount in the cell fraction after 0 . 5 h and then decreased rapidly accompanied by increases in the conjugates . this indicates that unconjugated free 4oh - cipc produced in hepatocytes was temporarily excreted in the extracellular medium and subsequently converted to the conjugates via re - influx into hepatocytes . 3 : diethylstilbestrol ( des ), bisphenol a ( bpa ) and 4 - hydroxybenzoic acid butyl ester ( butylparaben ), which are known xenoestrogenic compounds , competitively displaced 17beta - oestradiol bound to the oestrogen receptor - alpha ( eralpha ) in a concentration - dependent manner ; ic50 values of des , bpa , butylparaben and its derivative 3 - chloro - 4 - hydroxybenzoic acid butyl ester ( 3 - chloro - butylparaben ) were approximately 10 (- 8 ), 10 (- 5 ), 5 x 10 (- 5 ) and 5 x 10 (- 4 ) m , respectively . in contrast , neither cipc nor 4oh - cipc impaired the binding of 17beta - oestradiol to eralpha at concentrations ranging from 10 (- 9 ) to 10 (- 4 ) m , whereas at concentrations of > 5 x 10 (- 4 ) m , the binding affinity of 4oh - cipc was greater than that of cipc . in a proliferation assay of mcf - 7 cells , cipc , 4oh - cipc and 3ca did not increase cell numbers at concentrations ranging from 10 (- 9 ) to 10 (- 5 ) m , but these compounds at a concentration of 10 (- 4 ) m induced a considerable decrease in cell numbers relative to the control . the results suggest that even if cipc is metabolized to 4oh - cipc by hepatocytes , the chlorine adjacent to the 4 - hydroxy group added to the intermediate as well as 3 - chloro - butylparaben obstructs the appearance of oestrogen - like effects via an interaction between the intermediate and the er .	0
repairing collagen in dentin carious lesions . influence of sealing the material : a morphometric study .. objective : the aim of the present work was to morphometrically evaluate collagen in carious lesions sealed with calcium hydroxide , adhesive systems , glass ionomer cement , and an antibacterial cement . study design : samples of infected and affected dentin were stained with sirius red ( sr ). the areas intensively stained with sr were delimited , and the percentage of these areas was measured by blind calibrated examiners . the mean results were subjected to the kruskal - wallis test . results : the affected dentin sealed with ca ( oh ) 2 showed a better organization of the collagen in relation to the adhesive systems prime & bond ( p = . 0159 ) and adhese ( p < 0 . 0001 ). the affected dentin sealed with prime & bond promoted better increase of organized collagen areas in relation to adhese ( p = 0 . 0004 ). the infected dentin sealed with glass ionomer cement ( p = 0 . 0018 ) or antibacterial cement ( p = 0 . 0004 ) brought a significant increase in the organized collagen areas . conclusions : ca ( oh ) 2 is indicated to seal affected dentin and glass ionomer cement and antibacterial cement may be used for treatment of infected dentin . the addition of antibiotics did not influence the restoration of the infected dentin .	0
urinary bisphenol a and obesity : nhanes 2003 - 2006 .. background : bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a chemical suspected of causing endocrine and metabolic disruption in animals and humans . in rodents , in utero exposure to low - dose bpa is associated with weight gain . detectable levels of bpa are found in most americans due to its widespread use in the manufacture of food and drink packaging . we hypothesized that urinary bpa concentrations would be positively associated with general and central obesity . methods : cross - sectional analysis of urinary bpa concentrations , body mass index , and waist circumference in 2747 adults ( aged 18 - 74 ), using pooled data from the 2003 / 04 and 2005 / 06 national health and nutrition examination surveys . results : the creatinine - adjusted geometric mean urinary bpa concentration was 2 . 05μg / g creatinine ( 25th percentile : 1 . 18 , 75 % percentile : 3 . 33 ). relative to those in the lowest bpa quartile , participants in the upper bpa quartiles were more likely to be classified as obese ( quartile 2 odds ratio ( or ): 1 . 85 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ): 1 . 22 , 2 . 79 ; quartile 3 or : 1 . 60 , 95 % ci : 1 . 05 - 2 . 44 ; quartile 4 or : 1 . 76 , 95 % ci : 1 . 06 - 2 . 94 ). higher bpa concentration was also associated with abdominal obesity ( quartile 2 or : 1 . 62 , 95 % ci : 1 . 11 , 2 . 36 ; quartile 3 or : 1 . 39 , 95 % ci : 1 . 02 - 1 . 90 ; quartile 4 or : 1 . 58 , 95 % ci : 1 . 03 - 2 . 42 ). conclusions : higher bpa exposure is associated with general and central obesity in the general adult population of the united states . reverse causation is of concern due to the cross - sectional nature of this study ; longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the direction of the association .	1
acute toxicity of nonylphenols and bisphenol a to the embryonic development of the abalone haliotis diversicolor supertexta .. acute toxic effects and mechanisms of two typical endocrine disrupting chemicals , nonylphenols ( nps ) and bisphenol a ( bpa ), to the embryonic development of the abalone haliotis diversicolor supertexta , were investigated by the two - stage embryo toxicity test . the 12 - h median effective concentrations ( ec ( 50 )) of nps and bpa to the trochophore development were 1016 . 22 and 30 . 72 μg l (- 1 ), respectively , and the respective 96 - h ec ( 50 ) values based on the completion of metamorphosis ( another experimental endpoint ) were reduced to 11 . 65 and 1 . 02 μg l (- 1 ). longer exposure time and magnified exposure concentrations in the benthic diatom , that serves as both food source and settlement substrate during the metamorphosis , via bioaccumulation , led to the higher sensitivity of metamorphosis to target edcs compared with the trochophore development . the hazard concentrations for 5 % of the species ( hc ( 5 )) could be employed as the safety thresholds for the embryonic development of the abalone . the 12 - h hc ( 5 ) values of nps and bpa were 318 . 68 and 13 . 93 μg l (- 1 ), respectively , and the respective 96 - h hc ( 5 ) values were 0 . 99 and 0 . 18 μg l (- 1 ), which were at environmentally relevant levels . results of proteomic responses revealed that nps and bpa altered various functional proteins in the abalone larvae with slight differences between each chemical and affected various physiological functions , such as energy and substance metabolism , cell signalling , formation of cytoskeleton and cilium , immune and stress responses at the same time , leading to the failure of metamorphosis .	0
in - vitro study of the cellular viability and nitric oxide production by j774 macrophages with ceramic , polycarbonate , and polyoxymethylene brackets .. introduction : studies show that ceramic brackets are chemically inert in the oral cavity , whereas polycarbonate and polyoxymethylene brackets can degrade , releasing bisphenol - a and formaldehyde , respectively . in addition to the traditional cytotoxicity tests , the study of nitric oxide cellular production stimulated by a specific material has been shown to be a reliable tool for evaluating its cytotoxic potential . methods : we aimed to assess cellular viability by mtt ( sigma , st . louis , mo ): 3 ,( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl )- 2 , 5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay in a murine macrophage cell line j774 with esthetic brackets and quantify nitric oxide production by these macrophages . cell cultures were evaluated at 3 times : 24 , 48 , and 72 hours . results : cellular viability in all groups was higher at 72 hours compared with 24 hours . this increase was significant in the control and ceramic brackets groups . final means in the bracket groups showed no significant differences compared with the control group . nitric oxide production was significantly greater in all groups at final time . there was no significant difference between the final means of the bracket groups and the control group , although polyoxymethylene brackets showed significantly greater means at 24 and 48 hours . conclusions : final means in the bracket groups showed no significant differences compared with the control group .	0
glycosylation of bisphenol a by freshwater microalgae .. the endocrine disruptor bisphenol a ( bpa , 4 , 4 '- isopropylidenediphenol ) is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resin linings of food and beverage cans , and the residues from these products are then sometimes discharged into rivers and lakes in waste leachates . however , the fate of bpa in the environment has not yet been thoroughly elucidated . considering the effect of bpa on aquatic organisms , it is important that we estimate the concentration of bpa and its metabolites in the aquatic environment , but there are few data on the metabolites of bpa . here , we focused on freshwater microalgae as organisms that contribute to the biodegradation or biotransformation of bpa in aquatic environments . when we added bpa to cultures of eight species of freshwater microalgae , a reduction in the concentration of bpa in the culture medium was observed in all cultures . bpa was metabolized to bpa glycosides by pseudokirchneriella subcapitata , scenedesmus acutus , scenedesmus quadricauda , and coelastrum reticulatum , and these metabolites were then released into the culture medium . the metabolite from p . subcapitata , s . acutus , and c . reticulatum was identified by fab - ms and ( 1 ) h - nmr as bisphenol a - mono - o - beta - d - glucopyranoside ( bpaglc ), and another metabolite , from s . quadricauda , was identified as bisphenol a - mono - o - beta - d - galactopyranoside ( bpagal ). these results demonstrate that freshwater microalgae that inhabit universal environments can metabolize bpa to its glycosides . because bpa glycosides accumulate in plants and algae , and may be digested to bpa by beta - glycosidase in animal intestines , more attention should be given to levels of bpa glycosides in the environment to estimate the ecological impact of discharged bpa .	0
exposure to bisphenol a during the fetal and suckling periods disrupts sexual differentiation of the locus coeruleus and of behavior in the rat .. this study tested the effect of exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) early in life on the sexual differentiation in the brain and behavior in wistar rats . we administered bpa only to mother rats during pregnancy and lactation at a dosage of approximately 1 . 5 mg / kg per day far less than the no - observed - adverse - effect level ( noael ; 50 mg / kg per day ). control female offspring showed a higher activity , a lower avoidance memory , and larger locus coeruleus than the male controls , while the bpa - exposed group did not show any sexual dimorphism . bpa did not affect the reproductive organs or sex hormones . our results suggest that the current methods to determine the noael of artificial industrial chemicals may not be sufficient to detect a disruption of the sexual differentiation in the brain .	0
selective solid - phase extraction of bisphenol a using molecularly imprinted polymers and its application to biological and environmental samples .. molecularly imprinted polymers ( mips ) were prepared using bisphenol a ( bpa ) as a template by precipitation polymerization . the polymer that had the highest binding selectivity and ability was used as solid - phase extraction ( spe ) sorbents for direct extraction of bpa from different biological and environmental samples ( human serum , pig urine , tap water and shrimp ). the extraction protocol was optimized and the optimum conditions were as follows : conditioning with 5 ml methanol - acetic acid ( 3 : 1 ), 5 ml methanol , 5 ml acetonitrile and 5 ml water , respectively , loading with 5 ml aqueous samples , washing with 1 ml acetonitrile , and eluting with 3 ml methanol . mips can selectively recognize , effectively trap and preconcentrate bpa over a concentration range of 2 - 20 microm . recoveries ranged from 94 . 03 to 105 . 3 %, with a relative standard deviation lower than 7 . 9 %. under the optimal condition , molecularly imprinted spe recoveries of spiked human serum , pig urine , tap water and shrimp were 65 . 80 , 82 . 32 , 76 . 00 and 75 . 97 %, respectively , when aqueous samples were applied directly . compared with c18 spe , a better baseline , better high - performance liquid chromatography separation efficiency and higher recoveries were achieved after molecularly imprinted spe .	0
"""adhesive dentistry : the development of immediate dentin sealing / selective etching bonding technique .. a major objective of dental research over the past 60 years has been a search for the """" dream - team """" of dental adhesives . in fact , a recent medline search produced more than 6 , 500 papers on dentin bonding and its techniques . adhesive systems are designed to retain direct and indirect restorations , minimize leakage at the margin , and be simple to place while producing consistent results . the development of materials and techniques has an interesting history ; some have recirculated from the past and are being used in some form today . buonocore used the etchant phosphoric acid at the beginning of the adhesive revolution . though not accepted for many years it eventually became the """" gold standard """" for etching enamel . technique sensitivity moved it out of favor and , through the development of self - etching acidic primers , was eliminated from some adhesive systems . although these primers may have successfully addressed postoperative sensitivity , adhesion was compromised . the bond strength of these systems has now been improved with the incorporation of phosphoric acid - etch to condition enamel prior to using the adhesive system . this article will trace the history of adhesive techniques and materials and how it has led to the creation of a new technique that combines two bonding methods ."""	0
bond strength , interfacial characterization , and fracture surface analysis for a new stress - breaking bonding agent .. three commercial dentin bonding systems were analyzed by tensile bond testing , area analysis of fractured surfaces , and sem analysis of the tooth - resin interfaces . tensile bond strengths in megapascals ( sd ) were tenure - marathon v ([ t - m ]; 8 . 86 [ 3 . 02 ]), new system with low - viscosity resin ([ k - lvr - p ]; 6 . 50 [ 2 . 01 ]), and new system without low - viscosity resin ([ k - p ] = 7 . 28 [ 1 . 75 ]), which were significantly greater than scotch - bond 2 - p50 ([ sb - p50 ]; 3 . 96 [ 1 . 02 ]). gaps that ranged up to 5 . 6 microns ( mean for the group ) were observed around most of the restorations at dentin surfaces and less so at enamel surfaces , where some of the restorations remained free of gaps . the gaps near the dentin margin were significantly smaller for k - lvr - p than for sb - p50 . the tensile test revealed mixed failure modes in all systems , and in the cross sections of class v restorations , the gaps were confined to the dentin - resin junction .	0
induction of apoptosis by mono ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( mehp ) in u937 cells .. treatment of u937 cells with mono ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( mehp ) for 20 h led to a dose - dependent loss of cell viability , assessed by propidium iodide ( pi ) staining with fluorescent activated cell sorting ( facs ) analysis . the cytotoxic behavior of mehp is attributed to the induction of apoptosis . mehp induced activation of caspase - 3 , internucleosomal dna fragmentation and the morphological features of nuclear apoptosis . analysis with lightcycler quantitative rt - pcr demonstrated the decrease of bcl - 2 and increase of bax mrna levels . peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( ppar ) gamma antagonists , bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) and gw9662 , significantly inhibited the mehp - induced caspase - 3 activity and apoptotic nuclear morphological changes . furthermore , a ppargamma ligand , rosiglitazone synergized the mehp - induced caspase - 3 activity . these results suggest that mehp can induce apoptosis in u937 cells through modulation of the balance of bcl - 2 / bax in part by ppargamma activation .	0

bond strength of bis - gma and glass ionomer pit and fissure sealants using cyclic fatigue .. the aim of the study was to determine the bond strength of glass ionomer and resin - modified glass ionomer sealants compared to bis - gma sealants using both static and cyclic fatigue shear testing . four materials were evaluated : d , a bis - gma sealant with 10 % phosphoric acid etchant ; fc , a resin - modified glass ionomer sealant with 20 % polyacrylic acid etchant ; fd , a resin - modified glass ionomer sealant with 10 % polyacrylic acid etchant ; and fsc , a self - cured glass ionomer sealant with no etchant . gelatin capsules filled with the sealant material were bonded to the enamel surfaces of bovine teeth after appropriate surface conditioning and then tested in shear static and cyclic fatigue . static and cyclic shear bond strengths , respectively , for each group were ( mpa ): fc : 21 . 1 +/- 2 . 8 and 17 . 1 +/- 3 . 1 ; fd : 14 . 6 +/- 5 . 9 and 8 . 5 +/- 3 . 1 ; d : 10 . 8 +/- 4 . 9 and 4 . 7 +/- 2 . 6 ; fsc : 8 . 7 ( 1 . 0 and 2 . 9 +/- 0 . 6 . the resin - modified glass ionomer sealants had better fatigue bond strength than both bis - gma and self - cured glass ionomer sealants with the surface conditioning affecting the bond strength of the resin - modified glass ionomer sealants .	0
detection and characterization of mechanisms of action of aneugenic chemicals .. a comprehensive evaluation of the genotoxic potential of chemicals requires the assessment of the ability to induce gene mutations and structural chromosome ( clastogenic activity ) and numerical chromosome ( aneugenic activity ) aberrations . aneuploidy is a major cause of human reproductive failure and an important contributor to cancer and it is therefore important that any increase in its frequency due to chemical exposures should be recognized and controlled . the in vitro binucleate cell micronucleus assay provides a powerful tool to determine the ability of a chemical to induce chromosome damage . the application of an anti - kinetochore antibody to micronuclei allows their classification into kinetochore - positive and kinetochore - negative , indicating their origin by aneugenic or clastogenic mechanisms , respectively . the availability of chromosome - specific centromere probes allows the analysis of the segregation of chromosomes into the daughter nuclei of binucleate cells to evaluate chromosome non - disjunction . quantitative relationships between the two major causes of aneuploidy , chromosome loss and non - disjunction , can be determined . the mechanisms leading to chromosome loss and non - disjunction can be investigated by the analysis of morphological and structural changes in the cell division apparatus by the application of specific stains and antibodies for various cell division components . we illustrate such analyses by the demonstration of the interaction of the monomer bisphenol - a with the centrosome of the mitotic spindle and the folic acid antagonist pyrimethamine with the centromeres of chromosomes . both types of modifications lead to the induction of aneuploidy in exposed cells . our studies also implicate the products of the p53 and xpd genes in the regulation of the fidelity of chromosome segregation at mitosis .	0
regulation of uterine hsp90alpha , hsp72 and hsf - 1 transcription in b6c3f1 mice by beta - estradiol and bisphenol a : involvement of the estrogen receptor and protein kinase c .. we have previously demonstrated that bisphenol a ( bpa )- and beta - estradiol ( e2 )- induced increases in uterine weight and heat shock protein ( hsp ) 90alpha and hsp72 levels are mediated through the estrogen receptor ( er ). it is not , however , clear if bpa and e2 regulation of hsps is at the transcriptional or post - transcriptional level . therefore , in this study we examined the ability of bpa and e2 to increase uterine weight and regulate transcription of these hsps and of heat shock factor ( hsf )- 1 in ovariectomized b6c3f1 mice at 6 or 24 h after a single subcutaneous injection of e2 ( 1 microg / kg ) or bpa ( 100 mg / kg ). the role of the er and protein kinase c ( pkc ) in these e2 and bpa effects was evaluated by co - administration of the antiestrogen ici 182 , 780 ( 5 mg / kg ) or the pkc inhibitor gf 109203x ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ), respectively . the results demonstrated er involvement in uterine weight increases . uterine hsp mrna levels are increased by e2 and bpa through a direct effect on their transcription and / or , in the case of e2 , through an increase in hsf - 1 mrna . pkc is involved in the bpa - induced increases in hsp90alpha mrna levels . we conclude that e2 and bpa regulate hsp90alpha and hsp72alpha transcription via similar and distinct pathways .	0
determination of trace endocrine disruptors in ultrapure water for laboratory use by the yeast estrogen screen ( yes ) and chemical analysis ( gc / ms ).. high purity water for endocrine disruptors ( eds ) analysis in experimental tests is an indispensable requirement for the preparation of reagents and solutions employed in biological laboratories . commercial ultrapure water may contain traces of organic compounds , which can interfere with in vitro bioassays carried out to detect the potential estrogen - like activity of pure compounds and complex mixtures . this paper shows that solid - phase extracts of different types of ultrapure water ( upw ) purchased or produced in situ for laboratory analysis ( mq - upw ) may contain organic molecules able to antagonize the binding of e ( 2 ) to the human estrogen receptor alpha in the yeast estrogen screen ( yes ) assay . gc / ms analysis detected the presence of bis ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) ( 0 . 033 ppm +/- 0 . 006 ) in mq - upw extracts . the dose - response curve of dehp in the yes assay showed a relevant antagonist effect of this phthalate . agreement between content of dehp chemically detected in upw extract and the magnitude of biological effects induced was pointed out . it would be appropriate that chemical analyses were complemented by biological tests to establish concentration limits for chemical contaminants in upw that do not induce biological effects detectable in vitro . the yeast assay used in this study has previously proved to be a sensitive tool in assessing the presence of agonistic / antagonistic chemicals at the ng / l level in complex mixtures and may be successfully used to identify trace amounts of estrogenic / antiestrogenic chemicals , which can represent critical issues influencing the experimental results in environmental testing laboratories .	0
effect of waiting interval on chemical activation mode of dual - cure one - step self - etching adhesives on bonding to root canal dentin .. objectives : the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of waiting interval on the chemical activation of dual - cure one - step self - etching adhesives before placing resin core materials on the regional bond strength to root canal dentin . materials and methods : forty - eight post spaces prepared in human lower premolars were applied with four dual - cure one - step self - etching adhesives estelite core quick : ecb / ecq , clearfil dc core automix : cdb / cdc , unifil core em : unb / unc , beauticore : btb / btc as the manufacturers ' instructions . these adhesives were cured with light activation for 10 s , or chemical activation with 0 , 10 , and 30 s waiting intervals prior to placing resin core material . resin core materials were then placed into the post space and light - cured for 60 s . after 24h water storage , each specimen was serially sliced into 8 , 0 . 6 mm × 0 . 6 mm thick beams for the μtbs test . the regional μtbs data were analyzed using three - way anova and dunnett ' s t3 test ( p < 0 . 05 ). results : for the chemical activation with 10 and 30 s waiting intervals , ecb and cdb exhibited significantly improved μtbs , whereas for unb and btb , the μtbs were not significantly different but increased with waiting interval . on the other hand , light - activation of all the adhesives produced significantly higher μtbs to root canal dentin than chemical activation ( p < 0 . 05 ), except for the unb group . conclusions : for the chemical activation of dual - cure one - step self - etching adhesives , a waiting interval prior to placing resin core material improved μtbs to root canal dentin . polymerising the adhesives before polymerisation reaction of resin core material would be effective for bonding to root canal dentin . clinical relevance : for chemical activation mode as well as light activation mode , pre - curing of adhesive layer before proceeding polymerisation of resin filling material would produce higher bonding performance to dentin in the cavity .	0

study of 202 natural , synthetic , and environmental chemicals for binding to the androgen receptor .. a number of environmental and industrial chemicals are reported to possess androgenic or antiandrogenic activities . these androgenic endocrine disrupting chemicals may disrupt the endocrine system of humans and wildlife by mimicking or antagonizing the functions of natural hormones . the present study developed a low cost recombinant androgen receptor ( ar ) competitive binding assay that uses no animals . we validated the assay by comparing the protocols and results from other similar assays , such as the binding assay using prostate cytosol . we tested 202 natural , synthetic , and environmental chemicals that encompass a broad range of structural classes , including steroids , diethylstilbestrol and related chemicals , antiestrogens , flutamide derivatives , bisphenol a derivatives , alkylphenols , parabens , alkyloxyphenols , phthalates , siloxanes , phytoestrogens , ddts , pcbs , pesticides , organophosphate insecticides , and other chemicals . some of these chemicals are environmentally persistent and / or commercially important , but their ar binding affinities have not been previously reported . to the best of our knowledge , these results represent the largest and most diverse data set publicly available for chemical binding to the ar . through a careful structure - activity relationship ( sar ) examination of the data set in conjunction with knowledge of the recently reported ligand - ar crystal structures , we are able to define the general structural requirements for chemical binding to ar . hydrophobic interactions are important for ar binding . the interaction between ligand and ar at the 3 - and 17 - positions of testosterone and r1881 found in other chemical classes are discussed in depth . the sar studies of ligand binding characteristics for ar are compared to our previously reported results for estrogen receptor binding .	0
shear bond strength to moist and dry dentin of four dentin bonding systems .. purpose : to compare the shear bond strength of four single - bottle adhesive systems ( prime & bond nt , single bond , gluma comfort bond , gluma comfort bond + desensitizer ) bonded to moist and dry dentin . materials and methods : a column of resin - based composite was bonded to human dentin using the dentin bonding systems following manufacturers ' directions ( n = 12 ). for half the specimens , the dentin was dried completely after acid etching ( air dried for 10 s ). for the remaining specimens , the dentin was left moist ( glistening appearance with no puddles ) after acid etching . all specimens were thermocycled for 1 , 000 cycles at 6 - 60 degrees c , placed in a fixture on an mts machine and loaded in shear until failure . results : statistical analysis revealed that dentin condition ( moist or dry ) was significant for prime & bond nt , single bond , and gluma comfort bond . bonding to moist dentin produced higher bond strengths than bonding to dry dentin . for gluma comfort bond + desensitizer , no statistical difference was found between bonding to moist vs . dry dentin . over all , single bond and gluma comfort bond bonded to moist dentin produced significantly higher bond strengths than all other groups .	0
coagulation and stabilization of sterically functionalized magnetite nanoparticles in an organic solvent with different technical polymers .. this experimental study deals with the colloidal stability of sterically functionalized magnetite nanoparticles in a low dielectric constant organic solvent with different concentrations of technical grade polymers . those dispersions are the starting point of a solution and spray drying process chain to synthesize highly filled nanocomposite materials with nanoparticle volume concentrations exceeding 10 %. we introduce a thermo gravimetric method together with light extinction and dynamic light scattering measurements to gain quantitative information on the concentration of primary particles and the mechanism of destabilization or stabilization by polymer addition . poly ( vinyl butyral ) is found to stabilize the dispersion considerably caused by stronger interactions with the fatty acid coated magnetite particles quantified by means of adsorption measurements . both poly ( methyl methacrylate ) as well as two grades of poly ( bisphenol a carbonate ) are found to destabilize the dispersion due to depletion flocculation over the entire concentration range investigated however there is a significant quantity of a stable fraction of primary nanoparticles in the supernatant after depletion flocculation occurred . this fraction of primary particles is increasing with decreasing polymer concentration . we furthermore point out important concerns and limitations for the composition of and concentrations in such complex colloidal systems for use in industrially relevant processes .	0
the effect of food simulants on enamel - composite bond strength .. the effect of food simulants upon the enamel - composite bond strength of two orthodontic adhesive composites was studied . thirty extracted premolars were used in each experimental group . orthodontic brackets were bonded with either transbond ( 3m unitek ) or right - on ( tp orthodontics ) and were then exposed to either distilled water ( control ), 8 per cent ethanol ( aqueous food ), 50 per cent ethanol ( alcoholic food ), buffered lactic acid ph4 ( acidic food ), or corn oil ( fatty food ) for 12 weeks . bond strength and adhesive remnant index was recorded . it was found that 50 per cent ethanol had a significant effect upon the bond strength of both transbond and right - on . right - on was affected to a greater extent . the clinical significance of this finding is that alcoholic mouth rinses , and alcohol - containing foods and drinks may be a causative factor in bond failure . however , the use of an alcoholic mouthrinse late in treatment may aid bracket removal . this potential use requires more research . refereed scientific paper	0
effect of endocrine disrupters on macrophage functions in vitro .. in previous papers we reported that endocrine disrupters ( eds ) such as diethyl stilbesterol ( des ), 4 , 4 '- isopropylidene diphenol ( bisphenol a : bpa ), bis ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( ehp ) and p - nonylphenol ( np ) stimulated proliferative responses and cytokine productions of murine spleen cells and thymus cells in vitro . in this paper we report the effect of eds on murine macrophage functions in vitro . des , bpa , ehp and np stimulated thioglycolate - induced peritoneal exudate cells ( macrophages ) to produce cytokines such as interleukin ( il )- 1 , il - 6 , il - 12 , tumor necrosis factor and macrophage chemotactic protein - 1 . the effect of these eds was observed at the concentrations of 10 (- 6 )- 10 (- 8 ) m , and the maximum response was obtained at 10 (- 7 m .) the accessory function for t cell activation and cd86 expression , an important molecule for accessory function , was enhanced in eds - treated macrophages . these results suggest that eds have modulating activities of macrophage functions .	0

disruption of adult expression of sexually selected traits by developmental exposure to bisphenol a .. exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds ( edcs ), such as bisphenol a ( bpa ), may cause adverse health effects in wildlife and humans , but controversy remains as to what traits are most sensitive to edcs and might serve as barometers of exposure . expression of sexually selected traits that have evolved through intrasexual competition for mates and intersexual choice of mating partner are more dependent on developmental and physical condition of an animal than naturally selected traits and thus might be particularly vulnerable to disruption by developmental exposure to edcs . we have used the deer mouse ( peromyscus maniculatus ) as a model to test this hypothesis . adult male - male competition for mates in this species is supported by enhanced spatial navigational and exploratory abilities , which enable males to search for prospective , widely dispersed females . male deer mice exposed to bpa or ethinyl estradiol ( ee ) through maternal diet showed no changes in external phenotype , sensory development , or adult circulating concentrations of testosterone and corticosterone , but spatial learning abilities and exploratory behaviors were severely compromised compared with control males . because these traits are not sexually selected in females , bpa exposure predictably had no effect , although ee - exposed females demonstrated enhanced spatial navigational abilities . both bpa - exposed and control females preferred control males to bpa - exposed males . our demonstration that developmental exposure to bpa compromises cognitive abilities and behaviors essential for males to reproduce successfully has broad implications for other species , including our own . thus , sexually selected traits might provide useful biomarkers to assess risk of environmental contamination in animal and human populations .	0
disruption of the blood - testis barrier integrity by bisphenol a in vitro : is this a suitable model for studying blood - testis barrier dynamics ?. bisphenol a , an estrogenic environmental toxicant , has been implicated to have hazardous effects on reproductive health in humans and rodents . however , there are conflicting reports in the literature regarding its effects on male reproductive function . in this study , it was shown that in adult rats treated with acute doses of bisphenol a , a small but statistically insignificant percentage of seminiferous tubules in the testes displayed signs of germ cell loss , consistent with some earlier reports . it also failed to disrupt the blood - testis barrier in vivo . this is possibly due to the low bioavailability of free bisphenol a in the systemic circulation . however , bisphenol a disrupted the blood - testis barrier when administered to immature 20 - day - old rats , consistent with earlier reports concerning the higher susceptibility of immature rats towards bisphenol a . this observation was confirmed using primary sertoli cells cultured in vitro with established tight junction - permeability barrier that mimicked the blood - testis barrier in vivo . the reversible disruption of sertoli cell tight junction barrier by bisphenol a was associated with an activation of erk , and a decline in the levels of selected proteins at the tight junction , basal ectoplasmic specialization , and gap junction at the blood - testis barrier . studies by dual - labeled immunofluorescence analysis and biotinylation techniques also illustrated declining levels of occludin , connexin 43 , and n - cadherin at the cell - cell interface following bisphenol a treatment . in summary , bisphenol a reversibly perturbs the integrity of the blood - testis barrier in sertoli cells in vitro , which can also serve as a suitable model for studying the dynamics of the blood - testis barrier .	0
effect of adhesive systems and bevel on enamel margin integrity in primary and permanent teeth .. purpose : this study compared the effectiveness of self - etch and total - etch adhesive systems in bonding to the beveled and nonbeveled margins of primary and permanent teeth . methods : this in vitro , factorial - designed study allowed evaluation of 3 factors : ( 1 ) tooth type ; ( 2 ) presence of a bevel ; and ( 3 ) adhesive type . two preparations , each including a beveled and nonbeveled margin , were completed on buccal surfaces of 60 extracted molars ( 30 primary and 30 permanent ). preparations were randomly assigned to self - etch or a total - etch adhesive system and restored with resin composite . after thermocycling , teeth were stained with silver nitrate , sectioned , and measured for microleakage . statistical analysis used a repeated measures analysis of variance . results : beveled margins had less microleakage than nonbeveled margins for primary and permanent teeth ( p < . 001 ). total - etch had less microleakage than self - etch adhesives on primary ( 53 % less , p < . 001 ) and on permanent teeth ( 22 % less , p = . 01 ). self - etch had considerably more microleakage when enamel margins were not beveled . comparably less microleakage , however , was found for total - etch and self - etch in restorations with beveled margins . conclusions : total - etch adhesive and beveled margins resulted in the least microleakage . margin beveling has a greater effect in minimizing microleakage than the type of adhesive used .	0
dummy molecularly imprinted polymers as the coating of stir bar for sorptive extraction of bisphenol a in tap water .. a unique stir bar coated with dummy molecularly imprinted polymers for bisphenol a was prepared by sol - gel technique . the scanning electron microscopic image of the coating presented a homogeneous surface with a thickness of about 57 ± 2 . 5 μm . the fourier transform infrared spectrum of the coating proved the incorporating of dummy molecularly imprinted polymers with the sol - gel network . when used to extract bisphenol a from aqueous solution containing bisphenol a and its three analogs ( 4 - tert - butylphenol , 4 , 4 '- dihydroxybiphenyl , and 3 , 3 ', 5 , 5 '- tetrabromo - bisphenol a ). dummy molecularly imprinted polymers - coated stir bar showed better selectivity than the bars coated with polydimethylsiloxane or non - imprinted polymers . the extraction conditions including stirring speed , ph , and extraction time were optimized . after back extraction with methanol , the extracts were analyzed by high - performance liquid chromatography - fluorescence detection . the linear range was 0 . 0228 - 0 . 456 ng / ml with correlation coefficient of 0 . 9994 and the detection limit was about 5 . 70 × 10 (- 3 ) ng / ml based on three times ratio of signal - to - noise . the method was applied to the determination of trace bisphenol a in tap water .	0
suppression of no production and 8 - nitroguanosine formation by phenol - containing endocrine - disrupting chemicals in lps - stimulated macrophages : involvement of estrogen receptor - dependent or - independent pathways .. since the endocrine and immune systems share portions of some intracellular signaling pathways , endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) are considered potential agents for influencing inflammatory responses . here , we investigated the effect of edcs on lipopolysaccharide ( lps )- induced no production and nf - kappab activation in the raw264 . 7 mouse macrophage cell line . five phenol - containing edcs were investigated , namely bisphenol a ( bpa ), the alkyl phenols p - n - nonylphenol ( np ) and p - n - octylphenol ( op ), and the chlorinated phenols 2 , 4 - dichlorophenol ( dcp ) and pentachlorophenol ( pcp ). our results revealed that these chemicals dose - dependently suppressed lps - induced no production , as reflected by decreased no ( x ) content . the suppressive effects of bpa , np and op , but not pcp or dcp , were blocked by the estrogen receptor ( er ) inhibitor , ici182780 . elisa - based quantification of the dna - binding activity of free p65 nf - kappab showed that lps - induced nf - kappab activation was significantly diminished by edc treatment . furthermore , immunocytochemical analysis of 8 - nitroguanosine , a unique index of no - mediated signaling , showed that 8 - nitroguanosine formation increased in lps - stimulated cells , but this increase was inhibited by the tested edcs . these results demonstrate that edcs suppress no production and nf - kappab activation in lps - stimulated macrophages through er - dependent ( bpa , np , op ) and - independent ( pcp , dcp ) pathways . the edcs further inhibited 8 - nitroguanosine formation , suggesting that they interfere with no - mediated signaling . thus , edcs might play important roles in the inflammatory response and host defense system against foreign pathogens .	0

bisphenol a exposure in mexico city and risk of prematurity : a pilot nested case control study .. background : presence of bisphenol a ( bpa ) has been documented worldwide in a variety of human biological samples . there is growing evidence that low level bpa exposure may impact placental tissue development and thyroid function in humans . the aim of this present pilot study was to determine urinary concentrations of bpa during the last trimester of pregnancy among a small subset of women in mexico city , mexico and relate these concentrations to risk of delivering prematurely . methods : a nested case - control subset of 60 participants in the early life exposure in mexico to environmental toxicants ( element ) study in mexico city , mexico were selected based on delivering less than or equal to 37 weeks of gestation and greater than 37 weeks of gestation . third trimester archived spot urine samples were analyzed by online solid phase extraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry . results : bpa was detected in 80 . 0 % ( n = 48 ) of the urine samples ; total concentrations ranged from < 0 . 4 μg / l to 6 . 7 μg / l ; uncorrected geometric mean was 1 . 52 μg / l . the adjusted odds ratio of delivering less than or equal to 37 weeks in relation to specific gravity adjusted third trimester bpa concentration was 1 . 91 ( 95 % ci 0 . 93 , 3 . 91 , p - value = 0 . 08 ). when cases were further restricted to births occurring prior to the 37th week ( n = 12 ), the odds ratio for specific - gravity adjusted bpa was larger and statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ). conclusions : this is the first study to document measurable levels of bpa in the urine of a population of mexican women . this study also provides preliminary evidence , based on a single spot urine sample collected during the third trimester , that pregnant women who delivered less than or equal to 37 weeks of gestation and prematurely (< 37 weeks ) had higher urinary concentrations of bpa compared to women delivering after 37 weeks .	0
reinforcement of weakened cusps by adhesive restorative materials : an in - vitro study .. pairs of extracted premolar teeth were prepared with mod cavities reducing the lingual cusp at its base to one of five widths : 1 . 25 - 2 . 25 mm . one of each pair was then restored with one of five adhesive restorative techniques and the weakened cusp of both teeth fractured by a force applied to the cusp at an angle of 30 degrees to the long axis of the tooth . at all cusp widths a layered restorative technique in which the cavities were filled to the enamel - dentine junction with glass - ionomer cement and the enamel replaced by composite , reinforced the weakened cusp more than the other restorative materials tested . this combination of materials to reinforce weakened cusps is worth considering as a cost effective alternative to removing the cusp entirely and making a crown or protecting the cusp with a cuspal coverage gold inlay .	0
biodegradation of bisphenol a in aquatic environments : river die - away .. the biodegradability of bisphenol a ( bpa ) was assessed in surface waters from seven different rivers across the united states and europe . rapid biodegradation of bpa was observed in all rivers following lag phases ranging from 2 to 4 d . biodegradation half - lives for bpa were typically less than 2 d following the lag phase . mineralization of bpa was observed in all river waters , with average carbon dioxide yields of approximately 76 % of the theoretical maximum ( range 59 - 103 %) at the end of the incubation period (< or = 18 d ). short half - lives ( 0 . 5 to 3 d ) were noted for bpa biodegradation in river waters regardless of geographic location , sampling site ( i . e ., upstream vs downstream of wastewater outfalls ), sediment addition (< or = 0 . 05 %), and initial test chemical concentration ( 50 - 5 , 500 microgram / l ). subsequent studies conducted at environmentally relevant concentrations ( 0 . 05 and 0 . 5 microgram / l ) also indicated short half - lives ( 3 - 6 d ) for bpa and support the extrapolation of the half - lives measured in this study over a wide range of environmental concentrations . the fact that bpa was degraded rapidly in surface waters taken from diverse locations in the united states and europe as well as in studies recently conducted in japan suggests that bpa degrading microorganisms are widely distributed in nature . these observations provide clear evidence that bpa is not persistent in the aquatic environment .	0
adhesive layer properties as a determinant of dentin bond strength .. the goal of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that the properties of the resin adhesive might affect the microtensile bond strength ( mtbs ) of multibottle dental adhesive system . in order to alter the properties , the experimental resin adhesives containing 2 , 2 - bis ( 4 - 2 - hydroxy - 3 - methacryloyloxypropoxyphenyl ) propane ( bis - gma ) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ) at various ratios were prepared . degree of conversion immediately after curing ( dc - immed ), degree of conversion at 48 h after curing ( dc - 48h ) of a thin coat of the experimental adhesives , the flexural strength ( fs ) of the bulk specimens made of the experimental adhesives , ph , viscosity at shear rate of 1 s (- 1 ), and the microtensile bond strength ( mtbs ) values of the adhesives to dentin were investigated . the maximum mtbs and fs values of the resin adhesives were observed when the ratio of bis - gma / tegdma was 60 / 40 . however , ph and viscosity values increased with increasing bis - gma content in the adhesives . when bis - gma content was more than 60 wt %, the viscosity increased exponentially and restricted the dc and fs , and accordingly decreased the bond strength . the stronger the resin adhesives were , the higher the bond strength to dentin could be obtained .	0
acoustic emissions generated in aged dental composites using a laser thermoacoustic technique .. the heating up of dental composites by laser will produce acoustic emissions ( aes ) that may be related to fracture mechanisms in the composites . it has been proved that the mechanical properties of dental composites are affected by storage in food simulating liquids , i . e . 75 % ethanol , which has a solubility parameter approximating to that of bisphenol glycidyl dimethacrylate ( bisgma ) resin . a new method was innovated to evaluate the laser - induced aes in dental composites aged by 75 % ethanol solution . model systems ( 50 / 50 bisgma / tegdma resin filled with 0 % and 75 wt .% 5 - 10 microm silanized basio6 ) as well as three commercial composites ( marathon one , z100 and herculite xrv ) were used in this study . nine samples acting as the control group were tested to establish the correlation of aes to laser power . the effect of ageing by immersion in 75 % ethanol on aes and diametral tensile strength ( dts ) was then evaluated . a quasi - continuous wave co2 laser was used to heat up the composites . aes of frequency 100 - 200 khz were collected , filtered , recorded and processed using a 4610 smart acoustic monitor . burst patterns , which formally were assumed to be correlated to fracture mechanisms , were also identified from the data obtained at laser power > or = 5 w for commercial composites and > or = 4 w for model systems . higher laser powers cause the ae to increase for all composites except unfilled model resin . aes as a function of power for all aged systems were flat (< 100 events ) below 4 w . emissions then rose sharply to > 1000 events at 7 . 1 w . statistically significant differences were found between the aes obtained at 5 w ( commercial composites ) and those at 4 . 3 w ( model systems ) for material systems and storage times . marathon one was less affected by the laser and an abrupt change in ae was found between days 0 and 7 of storage for all commercial composites . the ae value from the unfilled model resin was found to be significantly different from that of the model composites . however , they showed an increase in aes with length of storage time , which was inversely associated with the decreased tendency of their immersed dts values . laser - induced aes may be a valuable adjunct to conventional mechanical testing .	0
weight - of - evidence evaluation of reproductive and developmental effects of low doses of bisphenol a .. recent public concern has focused on potential reproductive and developmental effects from exposure to low levels of bisphenol a ( bpa , cas number 80 - 05 - 7 ). two previous published reviews ( gray et al ., 2004a ; goodman et al ., 2006 ) conducted weight - of - evidence evaluations of in vivo reproductive / developmental toxicity from bpa exposure < or = 5 mg / kg - d based on studies published through february 2006 . here , an update of those analyses presents additional relevant studies that were published through july 25 , 2008 , and a weight - of - evidence analysis of the studies evaluated in all three reviews . as with the earlier literature , positive findings : ( 1 ) are countered by null findings in more numerous studies ; ( 2 ) have not been replicated ; ( 3 ) do not exhibit coherence and plausibility ; ( 4 ) do not show consistency across species , doses , and time points ; and / or ( 5 ) were from studies using non - oral exposure routes . owing to the lack of first - pass metabolism , results from non - oral studies are of limited relevance to human exposure . exposure levels in most of the low - dose oral and non - oral animal studies are generally much higher than those experienced by even the most exposed people in the general population . the weight of evidence does not support the hypothesis that low oral doses of bpa adversely affect human reproductive and developmental health .	0
investigation of adsorption behavior of bisphenol a on well fabricated organic surfaces using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy .. molecular adsorption of bisphenol a ( bpa ) on three types of self - assembled monolayers with different functionalities , such as - ch3 , - sh , and - cooh , was examined using surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) spectroscopy . bpa molecules in an aqueous solution were easily adsorbed onto a hydrophobic surface compared to a hydrophilic surface . sorption behavior of bpa into poly ( 2 - methoxyethyl acrylate ) ( pmea ) layer , which is known as a biocompatible polymer , was also investigated . sorption and desorption dynamics of bpa into pmea were found to be very rapid and quite reversible . the swelling of pmea by sorption of bpa results in the change in spr angle and allows one to quantify the bpa concentration below 100 ppm . in addition , the transport mechanism of bpa within the membrane of organ can be inferred by the experimental results .	0
effects of bisphenol a and tetrabromobisphenol a on sex organ development in quail and chicken embryos .. the plastic monomere bisphenol a ( bpa ) and the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol a ( tbbpa ) were examined for estrogen - like developmental effects on the reproductive organs in avian embryos . the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol ( des ) was used as a positive control . the test compounds were injected into the yolk of quail and chicken eggs early during incubation and the embryos were examined 2 d before anticipated hatching . at 200 microgram / g egg , bpa induced müllerian duct ( embryonic oviduct ) malformation in female quail embryos and feminization of the left testis ( ovotestis ) in male chicken embryos . the estrogenic potency of bpa compared with des was species and endpoint specific . müllerian duct malformation was the most sensitive endpoint in quail embryos , whereas ovotestis formation was the most sensitive response in chicken embryos . tetrabromobisphenol a caused high embryo mortality at 45 microgram / g egg in both species , but no estrogen - like effects were observed . bisphenol a caused mortality only in chicken embryos at 67 and 200 microgram / g egg . to our knowledge , this is the first report on estrogen - like or embryolethal effects of bpa and tbbpa in birds .	0
the effect of different porcelain conditioning techniques on shear bond strength of stainless steel brackets .. with the increasing demand for adult orthodontics , a growing need arises to bond attachments to porcelain surfaces . optimal adhesion to a porcelain surface should allow orthodontic treatment without bond failure but not jeopardize porcelain integrity after debonding . in this study , 90 glazed porcelain facets were divided into three groups according to different conditioning techniques : ( 1 ) roughening with a coarse diamond ; ( 2 ) hydrofluoric acid 8 %; ( 3 ) microetching with 60 micron aluminum oxide particles . each group was divided into three groups and stainless steel brackets were then bonded to the conditioned porcelain with three different dental adhesives . the adhesives used were : ( 1 ) silane + right - on ; ( 2 ) silane + concise ; ( 3 ) high - q - bond without silane . four additional facets ( three of which conditioned as above and one intact ) were analyzed macroscopically and by scanning electron microscopy . shear bond strength was measured with an instron universal testing machine and a macroscopic examination of the debonded porcelain surfaces was performed . results showed that shear bond strength was highly influenced by both conditioning technique and the adhesive . shear bond strength of the high - q - bond groups was significantly lower than both the silane + right - on and the silane + concise groups ; nevertheless the shear bond strength achieved by high - q - bond was enough to sustain full orthodontic treatment duration ( except for the group conditioned by roughening with a coarse diamond ). scanning electronic microscopy analysis revealed that diamond roughening and microetching produced only a surface - peeling pattern , whereas hydrofluoric acid conditioning produced an extensive in - depth penetrating pattern . hydrofluoric acid preparation produced greater shear bond strength than both diamond roughening and microetching . after debonding by means of a shearing force , the percentage of damaged porcelain surfaces in the silane + concise groups was significantly higher than the silane + right - on and high - q - bond groups .	0
the oecd program to validate the rat uterotrophic bioassay . phase 2 : dietary phytoestrogen analyses .. many commercial laboratory diets have detectable levels of isoflavones ( e . g ., phytoestrogens such as genistein [ gn ]) that have weak estrogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo . during validation studies of the uterotrophic bioassay , diet samples from 20 participating laboratories were collected and analyzed for three major phytoestrogens : gn , daidzein ( dn ), and coumestrol ( cm ). soy phytoestrogens gn and dn were found at total phytoestrogen levels from 100 to 540 microg / g laboratory diet ; a forage phytoestrogen , cm , ranged from nondetectable to 4 microg / g laboratory diet . the phytoestrogen levels were compared with both baseline uterine weights of the control groups and with the relative uterine weight increase of groups administered two weak estrogen agonists : bisphenol a ( bpa ) and nonylphenol ( np ). the comparison uses a working assumption of additivity among the phytoestrogens , despite several significant qualifications to this assumption , to estimate total genistein equivalents ( tge ). some evidence was found that phytoestrogen levels in the diet > 325 - 350 microg / g tge could diminish the responsiveness of the uterotrophic bioassay to weak agonists . this was especially true for the case of the intact , immature female version of the uterotrophic bioassay , where higher food consumption relative to body weight leads to higher intakes of dietary phytoestrogens versus ovariectomized adults . this dietary level is sufficient in the immature female to approach a biological lowest observable effect level for gn of 40 - 50 mg / kg / day . these same data , however , show that low to moderate levels of dietary phytoestrogens do not substantially affect the responsiveness of the assay with weak estrogen receptor agonists such as np and bpa . therefore , laboratories conducting the uterotrophic bioassay for either research or regulatory purposes may routinely use diets containing levels of phytoestrogens < 325 - 350 microg / g tge without impairing the responsiveness of the bioassay .	0
influence of prolonged thermal cycling and water storage on the tensile bond strength of composite to nicr alloy .. objectives : the purpose of this study was to evaluate the bond strength and bond durability of new adhesive systems ( both micromechanical and chemo - mechanical ) to a beryllium - free nickel - chromium alloy ( nicr ). methods : plexiglass tubes filled with composite were bonded to nicr alloy discs . groups of 24 samples were bonded using six different bonding systems . subgroups of eight bonded samples were stored in an isotonic artificial saliva solution ( 37 degrees c ) either for 1 d , 30 d or 150 d . in addition , the 30 and 150 d samples were thermal cycled for 7 , 500 or 37 , 500 cycles , respectively . results : the bond strength of a conventional bisgma composite to sandblasted nicr was statistically significantly lower than that of chemo - mechanical bonding systems and decreased continuously during the storage time of 150 d . the additional use of a silane on the sandblasted alloy resulted only in a slight , statistically insignificant increase in bond strength . statistically significantly higher and more durable bonds to nicr alloy were achieved either with the combination of silica coating and use of a conventional bisgma composite or with the combination of sandblasting and the use of a composite modified with a phosphate monomer . in these systems , the bond strengths were limited by the cohesive strength of the resin composites . however , a newly developed composite containing the same active phosphate monomer showed a statistically significant decrease in bond strength ( cohesive strength ) over storage time . significance : longer - term storage times in a wet environment are needed in laboratory tests to examine the durability of bonding systems .	0
conversion of dual cure luting cements .. this investigation determined the efficiency and rate of cure of polymeric luting agents when cured under manufacturers ' instructions with the appropriate visible light source , and under conditions where light was excluded and curing was reliant on the chemical reaction only . indentation hardness was used as a reflection of conversion . there was a rapid increase in hardness immediately after light curing followed by a steady increase in hardness over the next 24 h . the non - irradiated chemically cured samples exhibited steadily increasing hardness over 24 h , but were too soft to test in the initial 30 min . hardness values were extrapolated to obtain predicted values of flexural strength . dual curing was more effective than chemical curing alone . the results suggest that the formulation of dual cure materials is a balance between high levels of conversion in all aspects of the restoration and colour instability due to amine degradation . clinically there may be poorly cured areas in the deeper aspects of a deep cavity .	0
disposition of a low dose of 14c - bisphenol a in male rats and its main biliary excretion as bpa glucuronide .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a weak xenoestrogen mass - produced with potential human exposure . the disposition of bisphenol a in male fischer - 344 ( f344 ) rats dosed orally ( 100 or 0 . 10 mg / kg ) or intravenously ( 0 . 10 mg / kg ) was determined . smaller amounts of the dose appeared in the urine . the main excretion route was feces in rats irrespective of dose and administration route . the biliary excretion during 6 h was 58 - 66 % after iv dosing and 45 - 50 % after oral dosing at 0 . 10 mg 14c - bpa / kg . toxicokinetic parameters obtained from 14c - bpa - derived radioactivity in blood were the terminal elimination half - life , t1 / 2beta = 39 . 5 h , and total body clearance , cltot = 0 . 52 l / h / kg after iv dosing of 0 . 10 mg 14c - bpa / kg to male rats . the blood concentration reached its maximum of 5 . 5 ng - eq / ml at 0 . 38 h after oral dose . auc ( 0 - 6 h ), auc ( 0 - 48 h ), and aucinf of 14c - bpa - derived radioactivity , were 34 , 118 , and 192 ng - eqh / ml for the iv dose and 18 , 102 , and 185 ng - eqh / ml for the oral dose , respectively . the oral bioavailability of f ( 0 - 6 h ), f ( 0 - 48 h ), and finf were 0 . 54 , 0 . 86 , and 0 . 97 , respectively . the 14c - bpa - derived radioactivity was strongly bound to plasma protein ( free fraction , fu = 0 . 046 ) and preferentially distributed to the plasma with a blood / plasma ratio of 0 . 67 . from the bile of male rats orally dosed at 100 mg / kg , we have isolated and characterized bpa glucuronide ( bpa - gluc ) by esi / ms , 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy . hplc analysis showed that bpa - gluc was the predominant metabolite in bile and urine . unchanged bpa was mostly detected in feces . these results suggest that bpa is mainly metabolized to bpa - gluc and excreted into feces through the bile and subject to enterohepatic circulation in rats irrespective of dose and administration route .	0
non - genomic modulation of dopamine release by bisphenol - a in pc12 cells .. an endocrine disruptor chemical , bisphenol - a ( bpa ), is reported to have several short - term actions in various tissues and / or cells ; however , the mechanisms of these actions have not been fully elucidated . we investigated short - term actions evoked by bpa in pheochromocytoma pc12 cells . bpa elicited dopamine release in pc12 cells in a dose - dependent manner . a selective n - type calcium channel antagonist ( omega - conotoxin gvia ) and a ryanodine receptor blocker ( ryanodine ) inhibited the bpa - induced dopamine release . the expression of ryanodine receptor mrna was detected by rt - pcr in pc12 cells . subsequently , in order to prove whether membrane receptors participate in bpa - evoked dopamine release , a guanine nucleotide - binding protein inhibitor [ guanosine 5 '-( beta - thio ) diphosphate ], cyclic amp antagonist ( rp - camps ) or protein kinase a inhibitor ( h7 or h89 ) was added to pc12 cells prior to bpa - treatment . all of these agents suppressed bpa - evoked dopamine release , indicating that multiple signaling pathways may be involved in bpa - evoked dopamine release in pc12 cells . in conclusion , we demonstrated that bpa induced dopamine release in a non - genomic manner through guanine nucleotide - binding protein and n - type calcium channels . these findings illustrate a novel function of bpa and suggest that exposure to bpa influences the function of dopaminergic neurons .	0
horizontal and vertical distribution of estrogenic activities in sediments and waters from tokyo bay , japan .. endocrine - disrupting chemicals with estrogenic activity ( e . g ., alkylphenols ) have been detected in coastal japan . we aimed to determine estrogenic activity in extracts of river water , seawater , sediments , and sediment cores from tokyo bay by in vitro gene expression assay . fifty - one of 57 extracts had some estrogenic activity . e2 equivalents ( ng e2 equivalents per gram dry weight or per liter above the limit of detection ) in river water samples ranged from 0 . 70 to 4 . 01 ng / l ; in seawater samples from 0 . 34 to 2 . 52 ng / l ; and in surface sediments from 2 . 07 to 12 . 1 ng / g . the relationship between salinity and estrogenic activity in water samples suggested that fresh water is one source of environmental estrogens in tokyo bay . fractionation of sediment extracts showed that the highest estrogenic activity was observed in the midpolar fraction . the observed activities were compared with activities mediated by known concentrations of nonylphenol , bisphenol - a , estrone , and 17beta - estradiol . in sediment collected near the sewage treatment plants , the estrogenic activity of the midpolar fraction could be explained about 34 % by nonylphenol and estrone contained in this fraction . core sediment measurements detected estrogenic activity from as far back as the 1960s . the regulations on the industrial wastewater in early 1970s would be one of the main reasons for the lower estrogenic activity in the upper section of the sediment core . the high estrogenic activities as measured in water and sediment samples from tokyo might be restricted to certain coastal areas .	0
a study of post - operative sensitivity in class i and class ii restorations with self - etching adhesive and nanofilled composite .. aim : the aim of the study was to determine the type , intensity and duration of post operative sensitivity ( pos ) in class i and ii cavity restorations with self - etching adhesive and nanofilled composite . patients and methods : the clinical study included 34 patients , who received a total of 76 restorations by undergraduate dental students . the restorations were made in medium and deep cavities . self - etching adhesive adper promp l - pop and nanocomposite filtek supreme ( 3mespe dental products usa ) were placed . the type , the magnitude and the duration of postoperative sensitivity were examined on days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 14 and 30 . intensity of sensitivity perceptions were recorded on a visual analogue scale using the method of self - observation . parametric and non - parametric analyses were employed at a significance level of p < 0 . 05 . results : pressure - dependent pos was present in most of the cases ( 15 . 78 % +/- 4 . 209 ), followed by discomfort ( 9 . 21 % +/- 3 . 340 ) and pressure - and cold - induced pain ( 1 . 33 % +/- 1 . 147 ). a statistically significant difference was found between days 1 and 3 , and between days 5 and 30 , as well as between days 7 and 30 ( wilcoxon signed ranks test , p < 0 . 05 ). rapidly disappearing pos ( within 1 week ) had the highest percentage : 75 % +/- 9 . 934 . conclusions : following restoration of class i and ii cavities with self - etching adhesive and nanofilled composite pos was established in 26 . 3 % of the cases .	0
transmission electron microscopic study of interface between bioactive bone cement and bone : comparison of apatite and wollastonite containing glass - ceramic filler with hydroxyapatite and beta - tricalcium phosphate fillers .. we developed a bioactive bone cement that consists of apatite and wollastonite containing glass - ceramic ( aw - gc ) powder and bisphenol - a - glycidyl methacrylate ( bis - gma ) based resin . in this study , we made three types of cement ( designated awc , hac , and tcpc ) consisting of either aw - gc , hydroxyapatite ( ha ), or beta - tricalcium phosphate ( beta - tcp ) powder as the inorganic filler and bis - gma based resin as the organic matrix . these cements were implanted into rat tibiae and cured in situ . specimens were prepared 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks after the operation and observed using transmission electron microscopy . each of the bone cements was in direct contact with the bone . in awc - implanted tibiae , the uncured surface layer of bis - gma based resin was completely filled with newly formed bone - like tissue 2 weeks after implantation . the aw - gc particles were surrounded by bone and were in contact with bone through an apatite layer . no intervening soft tissue was seen . in hac - implanted tibiae , it took 4 weeks for the uncured layer to completely fill with newly formed bonelike tissue . the ha particles were also in contact with bone through an apatite layer . in tcpc - implanted tibiae , it took 8 weeks for the uncured layer to fill with newly formed bone - like tissue . the new bone that formed on the tcpc was not as dense as that on the awc or hac , and an intervening apatite layer was not evident . results indicated that awc had higher bioactivity than either hac or tcpc .	0
"""the reaction of skin to primers used in the """" single - step """" bonding systems .. a large number of direct bonding systems have been introduced for use by dentists and dental hygienists . although these agents are used for direct bonding of brackets to enamel , contact with skin , oral mucosa , and gingiva is not uncommon . these products have wide clinical use , but their biocompatibility characteristics have not been extensively investigated . the present study was undertaken to determine the effects of the primer component of mono - lok ( rocky mountain ) and the primer component of control ( lancer pacific ) on skin . three adult macaca mulatta monkeys were used in the study . the skin on their backs was shaved and the primer component of control , primer component of mono - lok , and saline solution were applied at different sites every 3 days for up to four applications . the skin was examined clinically and , 5 days after the last application , a biopsy was performed for histologic evaluation . the skin in contact with the primer component of mono - lok exhibited pronounced inflammatory changes and was characterized by swelling , vesiculation , and ulceration . histologic observations confirmed these findings by showing a marked inflammatory cellular response characterized by eosinophils . in contrast to these findings , the skin in contact with the primer component of control or saline solution exhibited normal architecture . histologic observations supported this appearance and showed minimal inflammatory cell infiltration . these results show that there are differences in the biocompatibility of direct bonding systems and that further studies are needed to clarify their long - term effects on patients and dental personnel ."""	0

bisphenol a exposure is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in postmenopausal women .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is widely used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins . there is increasing health concerns regarding low - level exposure to bpa among the general population . the aim of this study was to determine the association between bpa exposure with oxidative stress and inflammation in adult populations . a cross - sectional study was conducted . this study included 485 adults ( 259 men , 92 premenopausal women , and 134 postmenopausal women ) living in general communities within large cities . urinary concentrations of bpa , malondialdehyde ( mda ), and 8 - hydroxydeoxyguanosine ( 8 - ohdg ), white blood cell ( wbc ) count , and c - reactive protein ( crp ) were measured . multivariate analyses were applied to determine the associations of bpa exposure with oxidative stress and inflammation . the geometric means of urinary bpa for men , premenopausal women , and postmenopausal women were 0 . 53 , 0 . 61 , and 0 . 58 microg / g cr , respectively . the urinary bpa concentrations were positively associated with mda , 8 - ohdg , and crp levels in the postmenopausal women ; however , such associations did not exist in men and premenopausal women . the findings of this study suggest that bpa exposure would promote oxidative stress and inflammation , in which postmenopausal women are likely to be more susceptible to bpa - induced health effects .	0
peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor γ is a target for halogenated analogs of bisphenol a .. background : the occurrence of halogenated analogs of the xenoestrogen bisphenol a ( bpa ) has been recently demonstrated both in environmental and human samples . these analogs include brominated [ e . g ., tetrabromobisphenol a ( tbbpa )] and chlorinated [ e . g ., tetrachlorobisphenol a ( tcbpa )] bisphenols , which are both flame retardants . because of their structural homology with bpa , such chemicals are candidate endocrine disruptors . however , their possible target ( s ) within the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily has remained unknown . objectives : we investigated whether bpa and its halogenated analogs could be ligands of estrogen receptors ( ers ) and peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( ppars ) and act as endocrine - disrupting chemicals . methods : we studied the activity of compounds using reporter cell lines expressing ers and ppars . we measured the binding affinities to pparγ by competitive binding assays with [ 3h ]- rosiglitazone and investigated the impact of tbbpa and tcbpa on adipocyte differentiation using nih3t3 - l1 cells . finally , we determined the binding mode of halogenated bpas to pparγ by x - ray crystallography . results : we observed that tbbpa and tcbpa are human , zebrafish , and xenopus pparγ ligands and determined the mechanism by which these chemicals bind to and activate pparγ . we also found evidence that activation of erα , erβ , and pparγ depends on the degree of halogenation in bpa analogs . we observed that the bulkier brominated bpa analogs , the greater their capability to activate pparγ and the weaker their estrogenic potential . conclusions : our results strongly suggest that polyhalogenated bisphenols could function as obesogens by acting as agonists to disrupt physiological functions regulated by human or animal pparγ .	1

post - irradiation polymerization of different anterior and posterior visible light - activated resin composites .. the knoop hardness number was measured for bottom and top surfaces of 2 mm thick specimens of different anterior and posterior visible light - cured composites . the variables for this study included various exposure times and a series of time intervals from immediately after curing up to 72 h . post - irradiation microhardness at the bottom and top surfaces increased rapidly over the first hour , was slower during 24 h and showed no further increase after 24 h . increasing exposure time resulted in higher microhardness values at both surfaces . magnitudes of change were larger for the bottom surface . exposure times longer than those recommended by the manufacturers were needed , especially for the anterior microfilled composites , to achieve adequately photo - activated resin that had an optimum bottom / top surface microhardness of 80 - 90 %. maximum hardness values were found to be dependent on the volumetric fraction but not on the average inorganic filler size . the post - irradiation increase in hardness value was independent of composite parameters and is probably commensurate with polymerization kinetics .	0

in vitro fatigue behavior of restorative composites and glass ionomers .. objectives : this in vitro study was conducted to investigate the fatigue behavior of several dental restoratives , including composites , glass ionomers and a resin - reinforced glass ionomer . methods : fatigue was imposed under a reverse stress - controlled regimen , following a staircase approach . samples were stored and tested under both dry and wet conditions . the following parameters were measured and analyzed : young ' s modulus , restrained fracture strength , and flexural fatigue limit . results : as a general trend , all products showed a decrease in young ' s modulus following water sorption . for all products except the resin - reinforced glass ionomer , the same trend was seen in the restrained fracture strength . this is , however , no longer valid for the flexural fatigue limit : the trend is steady - state for the glass ionomers , status quo for the resin - reinforced glass ionomer , and all composites tested show a decrease . significance : the diversity in structure of both composites and glass ionomers does not allow findings for one product to be extrapolated to other similar products .	0
melatonin ameliorates bisphenol a - induced biochemical toxicity in testicular mitochondria of mouse .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a monomer of polycarbonate plastic used to manufacture plastic baby bottles and lining of food cans . it has endocrine - disrupting potential and exerts both toxic and estrogenic effects on mammalian cells . we studied bpa - induced perturbation of mitochondrial marker enzymes in testes of swiss albino mice and its amelioration by melatonin . mice exposed to standardized dose of bpa ( 10 mg / kg body weight ) orally for 14 days showed decrease in activities of marker mitochondrial enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase , malate dehydrogenase , isocitrate dehydrogenase , monoamine oxidase and nadh dehydrogenase . besides , it also affected activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase , glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase . bpa also caused lipid peroxidation ( lpo ) and decrease in reduced glutathione ( gsh ) content of mitochondria . concomitant melatonin administration ( 10 mg / kg body weight ; intraperitoneally for 14 days ) lowered mitochondrial lipid peroxidation . it also restored the activity of mitochondrial marker enzymes and ameliorated decreased enzymatic and non - enzymatic antioxidants of mitochondria . these results demonstrate that melatonin has a potential role in ameliorating bpa - induced mitochondrial toxicity and the protection is due to its antioxidant property or by the direct free radical scavenging activity .	0
monomethacrylate co - monomers for dental resins .. polymerisation shrinkage is widely recognised as a major drawback of resin based dental restoratives . bis - gma is often employed as the principal dimethacrylate monomer . due to its high viscosity , bis - gma is normally mixed with large proportions of low viscosity glycol dimethacrylates . the purpose of this study was to determine whether the polymerisation shrinkage of bis - gma - based resins would be lower if alternative monomethacrylate co - monomers were used in place of conventional dimethacrylate co - monomers as viscosity modifiers . conventional resins used were ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate ; the alternative monofunctional co - monomers were tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate , hydroxypropyl methacrylate and isobornyl methacrylate . model resins containing 54 % mol / mol of co - monomer in bis - gma and 1 % w / w of benzoyl peroxide as initiator were heat - cured at 70 degrees c for 8 h . polymerisation shrinkage , degree of conversion and concentration of remaining methacrylate groups were calculated from density changes obtained gravimetrically . other properties evaluated were young ' s modulus , water uptake and viscosity of the monomer mixtures . the bis - gma - based resins exhibited lower shrinkage when mixed using the monomethacrylates rather than with conventional glycol dimethacrylates . among the alternative co - monomers , tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate conferred the best balance of all measured properties .	0
association between urinary concentrations of bisphenol a and type 2 diabetes in korean adults : a population - based cross - sectional study .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a synthetic phenolic compound to which the general public may be exposed via consumer products and environmental contamination . we assessed the association between urinary bpa concentration and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes . this cross - sectional study included korean adult participants ( n = 1210 ) aged 40 - 69 years and was based on the 2009 korean national human biomonitoring survey . demographic characteristics and medical history of type 2 diabetes were collected from the participants by questionnaire , and bpa levels were determined by analysis of urine samples . the mean age of the participants was 53 . 4 years and 41 . 6 % were men ; the prevalence of type 2 diabetes differed according to demographic characteristics . the geometric mean urinary bpa levels of participants with and without type 2 diabetes were 2 . 03 and 2 . 40ng / ml , respectively . among bpa quartiles , no clear association was found between bpa levels and type 2 diabetes . although the adjusted odds ratio of type 2 diabetes was slightly increased for participants in the upper bpa quartile , the association was not statistically significant . these findings suggest that a high body bpa burden may not be associated with an increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes in korean adults .	0

influence of curing time , overlay material and thickness on three light - curing composites used for luting indirect composite restorations .. purpose : to assess the microhardness of three resin composites employed in the adhesive luting of indirect composite restorations and examine the influence of the overlay material and thickness as well as the curing time on polymerization rate . materials and methods : three commercially available resin composites were selected : enamel plus hri ( micerium ) ( ena ), saremco els ( saremco dental ) ( sar ), esthet - x hd ( dentsply / detrey ) ( est - x ). post - polymerized cylinders of 6 different thicknesses were produced and used as overlays : 2 mm , 3 mm , 3 . 5 mm , 4 mm , 5 mm , and 6 mm . two - mm - thick disks were produced and employed as underlays . a standardized amount of composite paste was placed between the underlay and the overlay surfaces which were maintained at a fixed distance of 0 . 5 mm . light curing of the luting composite layer was performed through the overlays for 40 , 80 , or 120 s . for each specimen , the composite to be cured , the cured overlay , and the underlay were made out of the same batch of resin composite . all specimens were assigned to three experimental groups on the basis of the resin composite used , and to subgroups on the basis of the overlay thickness and the curing time , resulting in 54 experimental subgroups ( n = 5 ). forty - five additional specimens , 15 for each material under investigation , were produced and subjected to 40 , 80 , or 120 s of light curing using a microscope glass as an overlay ; they were assigned to 9 control subgroups ( n = 5 ). three vicker ' s hardness ( vh ) indentations were performed on each specimen . means and standard deviations were calculated . data were statistically analyzed using 3 - way anova . within the same material , vh values lower than 55 % of control were not considered acceptable . results : the used material , the overlay thickness , and the curing time significantly influenced vh values . in the ena group , acceptable hardness values were achieved with 3 . 5 - mm or thinner overlays after 120 or 80 s curing time ( vh 41 . 75 and 39 . 32 , respectively ), and with 2 - mm overlays after 40 s ( vh 54 . 13 ). in the sar group , acceptable hardness values were only achieved with 2 - mm - thick overlays after 120 or 80 s curing time ( vh 39 . 81 and 29 . 78 , respectively ). in the est - x group , acceptable hardness values were only achieved with 3 - mm or thinner overlays , after 120 or 80 s curing time ( vh 36 . 20 and 36 . 03 , respectively ). conclusion : curing time , restoration thickness , and overlay material significantly influenced the microhardness of the tested resin composites employed as luting agents . the clinician should carefully keep these factors under control .	0
probing the activity differences of simple and complex brominated aryl compounds against 15 - soybean , 15 - human , and 12 - human lipoxygenase .. lipoxygenases ( lo ) have been implicated in asthma , immune disorders , and various cancers . as a consequence of these broad biological implications , there is great interest in understanding the effects of naturally occurring and environmental contaminants against its activity . on the basis of our earlier studies indicating that polybrominated diphenol ethers are potent inhibitors to mammalian 15 - lo , we expanded our structure - activity study to include marine - derived brominated phenol ethers ( including a newly discovered tribrominated diphenyl ether ), dioxins , and bastadins , as well as the synthetic brominated fire retardants , brominated bisphenol a ( bbpa ), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( pbdes ). we report herein the effects of 21 simple and complex organobromine compounds against human platelet 12 - lo , human reticulocyte 15 - lo , and soybean 15 - lo - 1 .	0
an investigation of the co - variation in circulating levels of a large number of environmental contaminants .. we are daily exposed to many different environmental contaminants . mixtures of these contaminants could act together to induce more pronounced effects than the sum of the individual contaminants . to evaluate the effects of such mixtures , it is of importance to assess the co - variance amongst the contaminants . thirty - seven environmental contaminants representing different classes were measured in blood samples from 1016 individuals aged 70 years . hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were used to assess the co - variation among the contaminants . within each identified cluster , possible marker contaminants were sought for . we validated our findings using data from the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) 2003 - 2004 study . two large clusters could be identified , one representing low / medium chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) (≤ 6 chlorine atoms ), as well as two pesticides and one representing medium / high chlorinated pcbs (≥ 6 chlorine atoms ). pcbs 118 and 153 could be used as markers for the low / medium chlorinated cluster and pcbs 170 and 209 could be used as markers for the medium / high chlorinated cluster . this pattern was similar to data from the nhanes study . apart from the pcbs , little co - variation was seen among the contaminants . thus , a large number of chemicals have to be measured to adequately identify mixtures of environmental contaminants .	0

expression of cytoskeletal proteins , cross - reacting with anti - cyp1a , in mytilus sp . exposed to organic contaminants .. the possible use of cytoskeletal components as biomarkers of organic pollution in mussels has been investigated . responses of non - muscular actin and tropomyosin ( tm ), two bivalve proteins that were recently demonstrated to cross - react with anti - fish - cyp1a , were analysed in digestive tissue of blue mussels ( mytilus sp .) exposed to a wide range of organic contaminants . the results were evaluated with elisa and western blot assays , utilising commercial monoclonal antibodies , and compared with expression of hsp70 , a marker of chemical stress . furthermore , mussels were sampled from the baltic sea at sites with different degrees of pollution to assess the expression of these proteins , and to monitor seasonal changes in relation to energy reserves and water temperature . the results demonstrated that expression of microsomal actin was significantly higher ( p < 0 . 02 ) in mussels exposed to a brominated flame retardant ( bde - 47 ), and lower , however not significantly , in specimens exposed to crude oil , alone and spiked with alkylphenols and pahs . hsp70 was strongly induced in all exposure groups , which also included bisphenol a and diallylphthalate . furthermore , microsomal actin exhibited seasonal variations , and expression was negatively correlated with water temperature . no correlation was seen between actin and the microfilament - binding protein tm , indicating that regulation of these two cytoskeletal components are not coupled . furthermore , parallel and significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) up - regulations of tm and hsp70 were seen in individuals sampled from a strongly polluted field site , whereas the seasonal analysis showed that tm expression was positively correlated with energy reserves ( total glycogen content ) in mussels , suggesting the use of tm as a marker of growth . in conclusion , this study has demonstrated the cytoskeleton to be a target of contaminants in mussels , calling for further attention . exposure - induced increase of microsomal actin can be interpreted either as stimulated actin synthesis , or re - arrangements of the dynamic microfilaments .	0

effect of propanal and diacetyl on quantity of remaining double bonds of chemically cured bisgma / tegdma resins .. the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of propanal and diacetyl addition on the quantity of remaining double bonds of chemically cured dental resins . propanal ( propionaldehyde ) or diacetyl ( 2 , 3 - butanedione ) was added to monomer mixtures , which were then made chemically curable . the monomer mixtures were varied with respect to content of propanal or diacetyl . addition of propanal or diacetyl to chemically curable resins resulted in a decrease in the quantity of remaining double bonds from 19 . 6 % to 1 . 9 % and from 19 . 6 % to 11 . 4 %, respectively . a negative correlation of statistical significance was found between content of propanal and quantity of remaining double bonds , while the relationship between content of diacetyl and quantity of remaining double bonds was found not to be linear . propanal was equally effective in reducing the quantity of remaining double bonds in chemically cured and in the light cured resins studied previously . as regards diacetyl , a more pronounced effect on quantity of remaining double bonds was noted for light cured resins as compared with chemically cured resins . the most likely common reaction mechanism of propanal and diacetyl seemed to be that of chain transfer reactions . furthermore , analysis of the data indicated a possible additional photoinitiating function of diacetyl .	0
sorption kinetics of ethanol / water solution by dimethacrylate - based dental resins and resin composites .. in the present investigation the sorption - desorption kinetics of 75 vol % ethanol / water solution by dimethacrylate - based dental resins and resin composites was studied in detail . the resins examined were made by light - curing of bisphenol a glycol dimethacrylate ( bis - gma ), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ), urethane dimethacrylate ( udma ), bisphenol a ethoxylated dimethacrylate ( bis - ema ), and mixtures of these monomers . the resin composites were prepared from two commercial light - cured restorative materials ( z100 mp and filtek z250 ), the resin matrix of which is based on copolymers of the above - mentioned monomers . ethanol / water sorption / desorption was examined in both equilibrium and dynamic conditions in two adjacent sorption - desorption cycles . for all the materials studied , it was found that the amount of ethanol / water sorbed or desorbed was always larger than the corresponding one reported in literature in case of water immersion . it was also observed that the chemical structure of the monomers used for the preparation of the resins directly affects the amount of solvent sorbed or desorbed , as well as sorption kinetics , while desorption rate was nearly unaffected . in the case of composites studied , it seems that the sorption / desorption process is not influenced much by the presence of filler . furthermore , diffusion coefficients calculated for the resins were larger than those of the composites and were always higher during desorption than during sorption . finally , an interesting finding concerning the rate of ethanol / water sorption was that all resins and composites followed fickian diffusion kinetics during almost the whole sorption curve ; however , during desorption the experimental data were overestimated by the theoretical model . instead , it was found that a dual diffusion - relaxation model was able to accurately predict experimental data during the whole desorption curve . kinetic relaxation parameters , together with diffusion coefficients , are reported for all resins and composites .	0
enhanced sonochemical degradation of bisphenol - a by bicarbonate ions .. sonochemical elimination of organic pollutants can take place through two degradation pathways . molecules with relatively large henry ' s law constants will be incinerated inside the cavitation bubble , while nonvolatile molecules with low henry ' s law constants will be oxidised by the oh (*) ejected from the bubble of cavitation . taking bisphenol - a as a model pollutant , this study points out an alternate degradation route , mediated by bicarbonate ions , which is significant for the elimination of micro - pollutants at concentrations present in natural waters . in this process , oh (*) radicals react with bicarbonate ions to produce the carbonate radical , which , unlike the oh (*) radical , can migrate towards the bulk of the solution and therefore induce the degradation of the micro - pollutants present in the bulk solution . as a consequence , initial degradation rate is increased by a factor 3 . 2 at low concentration of bisphenol - a ( 0 . 022 micromol l (- 1 )) in presence of bicarbonate in water .	0
bisphenol - a impairs memory and reduces dendritic spine density in adult male rats .. exposure to bisphenol - a ( bpa ), an endocrine disruptor used in plastics , occurs in the united states on a daily basis . recent studies suggest exposure during development causes memory deficits later in life ; however , the ramifications of exposure in adulthood are unclear . we examined the effects of acute bpa administration ( 40 μg / kg ) on memory and synaptic plasticity in adult male rats . bpa significantly impaired both visual and spatial memory and decreased dendritic spine density on pyramidal cells in ca1 and the medial prefrontal cortex ( mpfc ). additionally , bpa significantly decreased psd - 95 , a synaptic marker , in the hippocampus and increased cytosolic pcreb , a transcription factor , in mpfc . together , these findings show that a single dose of bpa , below the usepa reference safe daily limit of 50 μg / kg / day , may block the formation of new memories by interfering with neural plasticity processes in the adult brain .	0
dna - cyclodextrin composite material for environmental applications .. recently , we prepared water - insoluble and nuclease - resistant dna films by uv irradiation . the dna films accumulated the harmful dna - intercalating compounds , such as ethidium bromide and acridine orange . additionally , the water - insoluble dna films bound endocrine disruptors that had planar structures , such as dioxin derivatives , polychlorobiphenyl ( pcb ) derivatives , and benzo [ a ] pyrene . however , other harmful endocrine disruptors that lack a planar structure , such as bisphenol a and diethylstilbestrol , did not bind the water - insoluble dna films . therefore , we prepared the dna - cyclodextrin composite material by mixing the dna and the cyclodextrin - immobilized poly ( allylamine ) ( pcd ). as a result , these composite materials had properties of both the double - stranded dna , such as intercalation , and the cyclodextrin , such as encapsulation of an organic molecule into the intramolecular cavity . therefore , these materials could accumulate not only the harmful compounds with planar structures but also the nonplanar molecules , such as bisphenol a , diethylstilbestrol , and nonylphenol . these dna - pcd composite materials may have the potential to be novel environmental materials that absorb harmful compounds .	0

cytotoxic effects of resin - modified orthodontic band adhesives . are they safe ?. objective : to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of three different resin - modified orthodontic band adhesives . materials and methods : three resin - modified orthodontic band adhesives ( bisco ortho band paste lc , multi - cure glass ionomer band cement , and transbond plus light cure band adhesive ) were prepared and the samples were extracted in 3 ml of basal medium eagle with 10 % newborn calf serum for 24 hours . the l929 cells were plated ( 25 , 000 cells / ml ) in wells of 96 - well dishes and maintained in a humidified incubator for 24 hours at 37 degrees c , 5 % co ( 2 ), and 95 % air . after 24 - hour incubation of the cells , the incubation medium was replaced by the immersed medium in which the samples were stored . then l929 cells were incubated in contact with eluates for 24 hours . the cell mitochondrial activity was evaluated by the methyltetrazolium test . twelve wells were used for each specimen , and methyltetrazolium tests were applied two times . the data were statistically analyzed using one - way analysis of variance and tukey honestly significantly different tests . results : results with l929 fibroblasts demonstrated that all freshly prepared resin - modified orthodontic band adhesive materials reduced vital cell numbers ( p > . 05 ), in comparison to the control group . our data demonstrate that all materials showed significant cytotoxicity compared to the control group . conclusions : the results indicate that all materials showed significant cytotoxicity compared to the control group , and further studies using different test methods are needed for all resin - modified orthodontic band adhesives .	0
dose - dependent behavioral disturbances after a single neonatal bisphenol a dose .. bisphenol a is widely used in polymer products for food and beverage packaging , baby bottles , dental sealants , and fillings , adhesives , protective coatings , flame retardants , water supply pipes , and compact discs , and is found in the environment and in placental tissue , fetuses and breast milk . we have recently reported that neonatal exposure to other environmental pollutants can induce persistent aberrations in spontaneous behavior and also affect learning and memory functions in the adult animal . furthermore , recent reports indicate that pre - and perinatal exposure to bisphenol a can induce neurotoxic effects . the present study indicates that a single exposure to bisphenol a on postnatal day 10 can alter adult spontaneous behavior and cognitive function in mice , effects that are both dose - response related and long - lasting / irreversible . earlier studies on neonatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants ( pops ) have shown the cholinergic system to be a target of neurotoxicity , but here only minor effects on the nicotine - induced behavior was seen . furthermore , morris swim - maze and the elevated plus - maze did not reveal any effects on spatial learning and anxiety - like behaviors . the present findings show similarities with effects earlier reported after pre - and perinatal exposure to bisphenol a , and also with effects seen after a single postnatal exposure to other pops , such as pbdes , pcbs and pfcs .	0
identification of selected hormonally active agents and animal mammary carcinogens in commercial and residential air and dust samples .. in order to characterize typical indoor exposures to chemicals of interest for research on breast cancer and other hormonally mediated health outcomes , methods were developed to analyze air and dust for target compounds that have been identified as animal mammary carcinogens or hormonally active agents and that are used in commercial or consumer products or building materials . these methods were applied to a small number of residential and commercial environments to begin to characterize the extent of exposure to these classes of compounds . phenolic compounds , including nonylphenol , octylphenol , bisphenol a , and the methoxychlor metabolite 2 , 2 - bis ( p - hydroxyphenyl )- 1 , 1 , 1 - trichloroethane ( hpte ), were extracted , derivatized , and analyzed by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry ( gc / ms )- selective ion monitoring ( sim ). selected phthalates , pesticides , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ), and polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) were extracted and analyzed by gc / ms - sim . residential and workplace samples showed detectable levels of twelve pesticides in dust and seven in air samples . phthalates were abundant in dust ( 0 . 3 - 524 micrograms / g ) and air ( 0 . 005 - 2 . 8 micrograms / m3 ). nonylphenol and its mono - and di - ethoxylates were prevalent in dust ( 0 . 82 - 14 micrograms / g ) along with estrogenic phenols such as bisphenol a and o - phenyl phenol . in this 7 - sample pilot study , 33 of 86 target compounds were detected in dust , and 24 of 57 target compounds were detected in air . in a single sample from one home , 27 of the target compounds were detected in dust and 15 in air , providing an indication of chemical mixtures to which humans are typically exposed .	0
assessment of human contamination of estrogenic endocrine - disrupting chemicals and their risk for human reproduction .. there is broad human exposure to estrogenic endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ), but the data sets that exist are primarily for various environmental media such as food and water rather than the most relevant internal exposure . we have detected various kind of edc contamination in humans including dioxin and bisphenol a ( bpa ) widely used for the production of plastic products . bpa was present in serum and follicular fluid at approximately 1 - 2 ng / ml , as well as in fetal serum and full - term amniotic fluid , confirming passage through the placenta . an approximately five - fold higher concentration , 8 . 3 +/- 8 . 7 ng / ml , was revealed in amniotic fluid at 15 - 18 weeks of gestation , compared to other fluids showing increased exposure at the critical developmental period in humans . interestingly , serum bpa concentrations were significantly higher in normal men and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) compared with normal women possibly due to differences in the androgen - related metabolism of bpa . these findings may provide some insight into the metabolism of edcs in human and the pathophysiology of endocrine disorders such as pcos . dioxin contamination in relationship to development of endometriosis is also discussed .	0
shear bond strength of brackets bonded with hydrophilic and hydrophobic bond systems under contamination .. objective : to compare , in vitro , the shear bond strength ( sbs ) of two bond systems : transbond xt / xt primer ( txt / xt ) and transbond plus color change / transbond self etching primer ( tpcc / tsep ). materials and methods : each system was examined under four enamel surface conditions ( dry , water , saliva , and blood ), and 160 bovine teeth were divided into eight groups of 20 according to enamel surface condition . group 1 used tpcc / tsep and group 2 used txt / xt under dry conditions ; group 3 used tpcc / tsep and group 4 used txt / xt with water ; group 5 used tpcc / tsep and group 6 used txt / xt under saliva ; and group 7 used tpcc / tsep and group 8 used txt / xt with blood . brackets were bonded , and the samples were thermocycled 500 times between 5 degrees c and 55 degrees c ; they were then submitted to a shear bond test with a universal testing machine with a 50 kgf load cell at 5 mm / min . results : although water and saliva affected txt / xt more than they affected tpcc / tsep , there were no significant differences among the groups ( groups 3 and 4 : p = . 940 ; groups 3 and 5 and groups 4 and 6 : p = 1 . 000 ; groups 3 and 6 : p = . 988 ; groups 4 and 5 : p = . 690 ; and groups 5 and 6 : p = . 861 ). conclusions : the presence of blood resulted in the lowest sbs from both bond systems , but especially from txt / xt . tpcc / tsep resulted in a higher sbs than txt / xt under all conditions except the dry enamel surface .	0
tetramethylpyrazine attenuates ppar - γ antagonist - deteriorated oxazolone - induced colitis in mice .. tetramethylpyrazine ( tmp ) is suggested to have anti - inflammatory activity . the aim of this study was to determine the role of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ ( ppar - γ ) signaling in the pharmacologic effect of tmp on oxazolone ( oxz )- induced colitis . tmp ( 80 mg / kg / day i . p .) was administered daily 48 h after intrarectal instillation of oxz , with or without ppar - γ inhibitor [ bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) 30 mg / kg ] during the 4 days before sacrifice . the inflammatory response was assessed by the disease activity index , macroscopy , histology and myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) activity . expression levels of ppar - γ , nf - κb p65 , cox - 2 , inos and tnf - α mrna in colon mucosa were determined by fq - pcr , levels of ppar - γ and nf - κb p65 protein were analyzed by immunohistochemistry , and the total and phosphorylated levels of p38 mapk were assessed by western blotting . tmp significantly attenuated the damage caused by oxz and substantially reduced the rise in mpo activity , tnf - α , inos , nf - κb p65 and cox - 2 expression , as well as the increase in ppar - γ production ; however , no changes in the activation of p38 mapk were observed . inhibition of ppar - γ signaling aggravated inflammation of colon mucosa , and increased p38 phosphrylation . tmp counteracted the effect of inhibition of ppar - γ . we suggest that the effect of tmp treatment in ulcerative colitis may be related to ppar - γ signaling , but is independent of ppar - γ .	0
removal of endocrine disrupter compounds from municipal wastewater by an innovative biological technology .. the removal of selected endocrine disrupter compounds ( edcs ), namely estrone ( e1 ), 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ), 17alpha - ethynylestradiol ( ee2 ), bisphenol a ( bpa ) and 4 - tert - octylphenol ( 4t - op ) from municipal wastewater was investigated using a sequencing batch biofilter granular reactor ( sbbgr ), a new system for biological treatment based on aerobic granular biomass . this new biological treatment is characterized by high biomass concentration ( up to 40 g / l ), high sludge retention times ( up to 6 months ) and low sludge production ( i . e ., an order of magnitude lower than commonly reported for conventional biological technologies ). the investigation was carried out comparing a demonstration sbbgr system with a conventional full - scale activated sludge process . results showed that the sbbgr performed better than a conventional activated sludge process in removing e1 , e2 , bpa and 4t - op . in fact , the average removal percentages of the above mentioned edcs , obtained during a four month operating period , were 62 . 2 , 68 , 91 . 8 , 77 . 9 % and 56 . 4 , 36 . 3 , 71 . 3 , 64 . 6 % for the demonstrative sbbgr system and the conventional activated sludge process of the municipal sewage treatment plant , respectively .	0
12 - year survival of composite vs . amalgam restorations .. information about the long - term clinical survival of large amalgam and composite restorations is still lacking . this retrospective study compares the longevity of three - and four -/ five - surface amalgam and composite restorations relative to patients ' caries risk . patient records from a general practice were used for data collection . we evaluated 1949 large class ii restorations ( 1202 amalgam / 747 composite ). dates of placement , replacement , and failure were recorded , and caries risk of patients was assessed . survival was calculated from kaplan - meier statistics . after 12 years , 293 amalgam and 114 composite restorations had failed . large composite restorations showed a higher survival in the combined population and in the low - risk group . for three - surface restorations in high - risk patients , amalgam showed better survival .	0
effect of bisphenol a on murine immune function : modulation of interferon - gamma , igg2a , and disease symptoms in nzb x nzw f1 mice .. to investigate the effects of the estrogen receptor - binding molecule bisphenol a ( bpa ) on murine immune function in vivo , we fed a low dose of 2 . 5 micro g bpa / kg body weight / day to both normal c57bl / 6 and lupus - prone nzb x nzw f ( 1 ) ( nzb / nzw ) 5 - week - old mice for 1 week . analysis of concanavalin a ( cona )- stimulated splenic mononuclear cells by elisa demonstrated that bpa - fed c57bl / 6 males produced , on average , 40 % less interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ; p < 0 . 01 ) and c57bl / 6 females 28 % less ifn - gamma ( p < 0 . 05 ) compared with controls . treated female nzb / nzw mice were monitored for lupus disease symptoms , defined as proteinuria (> 100 mg / dl albumin in urine for 2 consecutive weeks ). before the development of proteinuria , bpa - fed nzb / nzw mice produced significantly less cona - stimulated ifn - gamma than did controls and displayed an average reduction of 50 % in immunoglobulin g2a ( igg2a ) antibody production from lipopolysaccharide ( lps )- stimulated splenocytes ( p < 0 . 05 ). it is striking that 5 - week - old female nzb / nzw mice fed a 7 - day low - dose course of bpa developed proteinuria an average of 7 weeks later than did controls . once proteinuria developed , splenocytes were stimulated with cona for cytokine analysis . the bpa - fed mice showed a dramatic reduction of 64 % in ifn - gamma production and a 32 % reduction in cona - stimulated interleukin - 10 ( p < 0 . 05 ). the long - lasting effects of bpa on ifn - gamma and igg2a production likely contributed to the increased symptom - free period of the nzb / nzw mice .	0
environmental pollutants and the thyroid .. common environmental exposures may affect thyroid function in humans . foetuses and infants are most vulnerable to these effects because they need thyroid hormone for normal neurodevelopment . perchlorate , thiocyanate and nitrate are all competitive inhibitors of the sodium / iodine symporter ( nis ) in pharmacologic doses , but their effects on human thyroid function at environmental exposure levels remain unclear . many compounds , including polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ), polybrominated diphenylethers ( pbdes ), bisphenol - a ( bpa ) and triclosan , may have direct actions on the thyroid hormone receptor , but these effects are complex and are not yet well understood . isoflavones inhibit thyroperoxidase ( tpo ) activity , and , therefore , may cause goitre and hypothyroidism if ingested at high levels , particularly in iodine - deficient individuals . organochlorine pesticides and dioxins may decrease serum t ( 4 ) half - life by activating hepatic enzymes . additional studies are needed to further elucidate the risk posed by these and other potentially thyroid - disrupting compounds .	0
estrogen stimulates proliferation and differentiation of neural stem / progenitor cells through different signal transduction pathways .. our previous study indicated that both 17β - estradiol ( e2 ), known to be an endogenous estrogen , and bisphenol a ( bpa ), known to be a xenoestrogen , could positively influence the proliferation or differentiation of neural stem / progenitor cells ( ns / pcs ). the aim of the present study was to identify the signal transduction pathways for estrogenic activities promoting proliferation and differentiation of ns / pcs via well known nuclear estrogen receptors ( ers ) or putative membrane - associated ers . ns / pcs were cultured from the telencephalon of 15 - day - old rat embryos . in order to confirm the involvement of nuclear ers for estrogenic activities , their specific antagonist , ici - 182 , 780 , was used . the presence of putative membrane - associated er was functionally examined as to whether e2 can activate rapid intracellular signaling mechanism . in order to confirm the involvement of membrane - associated ers for estrogenic activities , a cell - impermeable e2 , bovine serum albumin - conjugated e2 ( e2 - bsa ) was used . we showed that e2 could rapidly activate extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 / 2 ( erk 1 / 2 ), which was not inhibited by ici - 182 , 780 . ici - 182 , 780 abrogated the stimulatory effect of these estrogens ( e2 and bpa ) on the proliferation of ns / pcs , but not their effect on the differentiation of the ns / pcs into oligodendroglia . furthermore , e2 - bsa mimicked the activity of differentiation from ns / pcs into oligodendroglia , but not the activity of proliferation . our study suggests that ( 1 ) the estrogen induced proliferation of ns / pcs is mediated via nuclear ers ; ( 2 ) the oligodendroglial generation from ns / pcs is likely to be stimulated via putative membrane - associated ers .	0
comparison of vitellogenin responses in zebrafish and rainbow trout following exposure to environmental estrogens .. in this comparative study , the suitability of the commonly used in vivo biomarker for estrogenicity , vitellogenin ( vtg ), upon waterborne exposure to known environmental estrogens is evaluated in both male zebrafish ( danio rerio ) and juvenile rainbow trout ( oncorhynchus mykiss ). the results from initial experiments in which both species were exposed to 4 - tert - octylphenol ( op ) or 17 alpha - ethynylestradiol under semistatic conditions for 3 weeks demonstrated a difference in species sensitivity for op exposure . additional dose - response studies ( semistatic , 3 weeks ) with 4 - nonylphenol ( 20 , 100 , and 500 microg / l ), bisphenol a ( 40 , 200 , and 1000 microg / l ), dibutylphthalate ( 40 , 200 , and 1000 microg / l dbp ), and 17beta - estradiol ( 20 and 100 ng / l e2 ) were conducted . all these compounds , except for dbp , were found to be estrogenic to both fish species . the results demonstrated a difference in species sensitivity for np with the zebrafish being about 5 times less sensitive . for the other compounds tested , no indications for a difference in species sensitivity was found . the results from this study demonstrated that both fish species can be used for the detection of vtg as biomarker for estrogenicity , taken into the potential interspecies differences in sensitivity which might be important for the evaluation of fish population effects .	0
the effect of cure rate on the mechanical properties of dental resins .. objective : this study investigates the effect of cure rate on the mechanical properties of a common dimethacrylate dental resin formulation ( 75 / 25 wt % bis - gma / tegdma ). methods : the polymerization rate and final conversion of the exact specimens subsequently used for mechanical testing were monitored by near - infrared ( near - ir ) spectroscopy . the glass transition temperature ( t ( g )) and modulus , as a function of temperature , were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis ( dma ). iniferter initiating systems were used to create partially cured networks that did not contain any trapped radicals . by the elimination of trapped radicals from the system , the formed networks can be characterized as a function of both temperature and double bond conversion without inducing additional thermal cure during testing . results : copolymer specimens were cured with uv and visible light initiating systems , uv light intensities that varied by over four orders of magnitude , and cure temperatures that differed by 60 degrees c . even though the polymerization rates for these resins were vastly different , similar t ( g ) and modulus were measured for specimens cured to the same final double bond conversion . significance : this study shows that highly cross - linked dimethacrylate systems , such as bis - gma / tegdma , exhibit similar network structure and properties as a function of double bond conversion , regardless of the method or rate of cure .	0
adverse surface interactions between one - bottle light - cured adhesives and chemical - cured composites .. objectives : this study examined the effect of one - bottle adhesives with different acidities on bonding to chemical - cured and light - cured resin composites . methods : twenty - four non - carious human third molars were divided into eight groups . a flat dentin surface was created for each tooth . acid - conditioned dentin surfaces were bonded with prime & bond nt ( dentsply ), optibond solo ( kerr ), single bond ( 3m ) or one - step ( bisco ). each adhesive group was covered with composite buildups , using either a light - cured ( z100 , 3m ) or a chemical - cured composite ( bisfil 2 , bisco ). specimens were vertically sectioned into 0 . 9x0 . 9 mm beams . microtensile bond strengths were recorded and failure modes were classified using a stereoscopical microscope . four representative beams from each group were further prepared for sem examination . results : two - way anova showed that the effect of adhesive types , composite curing modes and their interaction were statistically significant ( p < 0 . 001 ). multiple comparison tests revealed no statistically significant difference in the bond strength of the four adhesives with the light - cured composite ( p > 0 . 05 ). however , they were significantly lower when used with the chemical - cured composite ( p < 0 . 01 ). a positive correlation was observed between the acidity of adhesives and the bond strengths of the chemical - cured composite . failure occurred predominantly along the composite - adhesive interface , with microporosities on the adhesive surface and voids within the chemical - cured composite . significance : air incorporated during mixing of chemical - cured composites only contributed partially to the decreased bond strength observed in simplified - step adhesives . ultrastructural observations suggested the presence of a surface interaction between the uncured , acidic resin monomers from the oxygen inhibition layer of the adhesive and the initiator components in the chemical - cured composite .	0
"""stimulated embryo production as a parameter of estrogenic exposure via sediments in the freshwater mudsnail potamopyrgus antipodarum .. the effects of three suspected endocrine disrupting chemicals , the xeno - estrogens bisphenol a ( bpa ), 4 - tert - octylphenol ( op ) and 4 - n - nonylphenol ( np ), were investigated in a whole - sediment biotest with the freshwater mudsnail potamopyrgus antipodarum ( gastropoda , prosobranchia ). artificial sediments were spiked with five nominal concentrations ( six for np ), ranging from 1 - 300 microg / kg dry weight ( 1 - 1000 microg / kg for np ). after 2 , 4 and 8 weeks of exposure , the responses of the test species were analysed . p . antipodarum exhibited a distinct increase in the number of embryos sheltered in its brood pouch in a time - and concentration - dependent manner in comparison to the solvent control sediment for bpa and op . the number of """" new """", still unshelled embryos turned out to be the most sensitive parameter . the lowest observed effect concentration ( loec ) was equivalent to the lowest administered concentration ( 1 microg / kg for each test compound ) for most parameters after 8 weeks of exposure . the calculation of effect concentrations resulted in even lower values for bpa ( unshelled embryos after 2 weeks : ec ( 10 ) 0 . 22 microg bpa / kg , ec ( 50 ) 24 . 5 microg bpa / kg ; after 4 weeks : ec ( 10 ) 0 . 19 microg bpa / kg , ec ( 50 ) 5 . 67 microg bpa / kg ) and op ( unshelled embryos after 4 weeks : ec ( 10 ) 4 ng op / kg , ec ( 50 ) 0 . 07 microg op / kg ). for np , there was no clear concentration - dependent response , and therefore , no ec ( 10 ) or ec ( 50 ) could be estimated , but the data suggest an inverted u - shape type of curve . the loec in the experiments with np was 10 microg / kg . our results indicate that p . antipodarum is highly sensitive to the tested endocrine disruptors at environmentally relevant concentrations . furthermore , the biotest with p . antipodarum is a useful tool for the identification of sediment - bound pollutants and for the assessment of sediment quality ."""	0
in vitro evaluation of different techniques of enamel preparation for pit and fissure sealing .. purpose : to compare the penetration and the imperviousness of two pit and fissure sealants according to surface treatments involving different cleaning procedures with or without subsequent acid etching . materials and methods : two sealants were used : a resin - based sealant ( concise white sealant ) and a compomer - based material ( dyract seal ) coupled with an enamel - dentin bonding agent ( dyract seal and prime & bond nt ). extracted molars ( n = 120 ) were randomly divided into 12 groups : 4 control and 8 experimental groups that received different surface treatments . pumice , alumina , or bicarbonate was used to clean the surfaces . phosphoric acid or non - rinse conditioner was used as acid etching agents . after sealing , the concise white sealant groups were directly thermocycled for 1800 cycles , while the dyract seal groups were stored in water for one month before thermocycling . after apex sealing and varnish coating , the fillings were stained with silver nitrate and embedded . three to 6 cross sections of 200 microm each were made per sample to assess both sealant penetration (% of the length of the fissure ) and the imperviousness of the seal ( scores method ). results : concise white sealant achieves a better enamel sealing than dyract seal when the teeth are treated with air abrasion or air polishing followed by etching . acid etching is essential for good sealing , whatever the material and cleaning technique tested . only the combination of air abrasion and phosphoric acid etching yielded a leak - free joint . conclusion : this study clearly shows that penetration and sealing are two different phenomena . ideally , an efficient sealant must have a good sealing ability and a high rate of infiltration as well , but these two properties probably do not have the same clinical relevance . the imperviousness of the seal remains the most important requirement .	0
competitive interactions of chlorinated phenol compounds with 3 , 3 ', 5 - triiodothyronine binding to transthyretin : detection of possible thyroid - disrupting chemicals in environmental waste water .. chlorinated phenol compounds , such as the chlorinated derivatives of bisphenol a , have been detected in effluents from paper manufacturing plants . we investigated the effects of bisphenol a , nonylphenol , and their seven chlorinated derivatives on 3 , 3 ', 5 -[( 125 ) i ] triiodothyronine ([( 125 ) i ] t ( 3 )) binding to purified chicken and bullfrog transthyretin ( cttr and bttr ) and to the ligand - binding domains of chicken and bullfrog thyroid hormone receptor beta ( ctr lbd and btr lbd ). the concentrations at which the chlorinated derivatives displaced [( 125 ) i ] t ( 3 ) from ttr were 10 - 10 ( 3 ) times less than those of their parent molecules . 2 , 6 - dichloro - 4 - nonylphenol and 3 , 3 ', 5 - trichlorobisphenol a were the most potent competitors of t ( 3 ) binding to cttr and to bttr , respectively . the interactions of the chlorinated derivatives with the ctr and the btr lbds were weaker than those of the chlorinated derivatives with cttr and bttr . chlorinated derivatives with a greater degree of chlorination were more efficient competitors of t ( 3 ) binding to ttr and tr . a structure - activity relationship between the phenol compounds and ttr ( ttr assay ) and tr ( tr assay ) was established . structures with chlorine in either ortho position or both ortho positions , with respect to the hydroxy group , were more efficient competitors . chemicals that interacted with bttr , cttr , and japanese quail ttr were detected in water downstream of effluents from paper manufacturing plants using the ttr assay . as some of the chlorinated bisphenols and nonylphenols were potent competitors of t ( 3 ) binding to ttrs , the ttr assay could be applied as primary screening for possible thyroid - disrupting chemicals in environmental waste water .	0

perinatal exposure to bisphenol - a changes n - methyl - d - aspartate receptor expression in the hippocampus of male rat offspring .. bisphenol - a ( bpa ) is one of the most common environmental endocrine disrupters with mixed estrogen agonist / antagonist properties . the toxicity of bpa has been extensively evaluated in a variety of tests in rodents , including developmental and reproductive toxicity , and carcinogenicity . the objective of the present study is to evaluate whether or not perinatal maternal exposure to bpa at 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 , 5 , 50 , and 200 mg / kg / d affects n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor ( nmdar ) subunits nr1 , nr2a , 2b , estrogen receptor beta ( erbeta ), and aromatase cytochrome p450 ( p450arom ) protein expressions of hippocampus in male rat offspring during postnatal development . western - blotting analyses showed that perinatal exposure to bpa significantly affected the expression of nmdar subunits . at the lower doses of 0 . 05 to 50 mg / kg / d , bpa concentration dependently inhibited the expression of nmdar subunits . however , at the higher dose ( 200 mg / kg / d ), the effects of bpa on these subunits were different , with a stronger inhibition of nr1 expression and a slighter inhibition of nr2a , 2b expression when compared with those at the lower dosage of bpa . in addition , perinatal exposure to bpa inhibited the expression of erbeta protein , but increased p450arom protein expression in a concentration - dependent manner , especially during the early postnatal period ( the first 1 - 3 postnatal weeks ). no significant influence of bpa on p450arom was observed at postnatal week 8 . these data suggest that environmental bpa exposure may affect the development of the brain , enhancing the local biosynthesis of estrogen in the brain , inhibiting erbeta and nmdar expressions .	0
quantum yield of conversion of the photoinitiator camphorquinone .. the primary absorber in dental resins is the photoinitiator , which starts the photo polymerization process . we studied the quantum yield of conversion of camphorquinone ( cq ), a blue light photoinitiator , in dental resin composites using a led lamp ( 3m freelight ) and a quartz tungsten halogen ( qth ) lamp ( vip ) as the light curing units at five different irradiances . the molar extinction coefficient , epsilon ( 469 ), of cq was 46 +/- 2 cm (- 1 )/( mol / l ) at 469 nm . the reciprocity of irradiance and exposure time holds for changes of cq absorption coefficient , that is , irradiance x exposure time (= radiant exposure )= constant . both led and qth lamps yielded the same curing threshold ( the radiant exposure when cq absorption drops to 1 / e ) and the same quantum yield conversion under different irradiances . in our dental resin formulation ( 0 . 7 wt .% cq with reducing agents 0 . 35 wt .% dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate ( dmaema ) and 0 . 05 wt .% butylated hydroxytoluene ( bht )) the quantum yield was measured as 0 . 07 +/- 0 . 01 cq conversion per absorbed photon .	0

leached components from dental composites in oral simulating fluids and the resultant composite strengths .. the aim of this study was to analyse the leached moieties of dental composites after storage in ethanol and organic acids of plaque and further evaluate the resultant effect on the diametral tensile strength ( dts ) of the composites . three commercial composites were used : bis - gma - based z100 , bis - gma / udma - based heliomolar , and bis - mpepp - based marathon one . the solutions used were : 99 . 9 % acetic acid , 99 % propionic acid and 75 % ethanol . specimens ( 4 mm diam . x 2 mm thick ) were stored at 37 degrees c in 3 ml of solution for up to 30 days . gas chromatography / mass spectrometry was used to characterize the leached moieties and dts of the specimens after immersion was evaluated . data were analysed using anova and tukey lsd test . the eluted substances were not all the same in different solutions and composites but mostly increased with immersion time , and included diluents ( tegdma and decamethacrylate ) and some additives , such as an ultra - violet stabilizer ( tinuvinp ), plasticizers ( dicyclohexyl phthalate and bis ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ), initiator ( triphenyl stibine ), coupling agent ( gamma - methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane ), and phenyl benzoate . the chief polymerizing monomers were not found . more kinds of components were found in the acetic acid and ethanol groups studied . the fewest kinds and quantities of leached moieties were found for bis - gma specimens and then bis - gma / udma ones , most of which are diluent agents . bis - mpepp specimens leached the most substances , which were composed mostly of a short phenyl group chain structure . the bisgma composite showed the highest dts ( 54 . 8 +/- 5 . 7 mpa ), which was not greatly affected by the length of storage . bis - gma / udma ( 36 . 2 +/- 6 . 8 mpa ) and bis - mpepp ( 26 . 1 +/- 4 . 5 mpa ) composites were significantly reduced ( p < 0 . 05 ) after 30 days storage in the ethanol ( 35 - 50 %), in the propionic acid ( 25 - 30 %), and in the acetic acid ( 40 - 60 %). irreversible processes such as the leaching of components occur in fluids simulating an oral environment , which may contribute to irreversible material degradation , especially for non - bis - gma - based composites .	0
effect of food stimulated liquids and thermocycling on the monomer elution from a nanofilled composite .. the present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of food simulating liquids and thermocycling on the elution of monomers from a nanofilled resin composite in different immersion times . five specimen discs were made from a nano - hybrid composite ( supreme 3m ) for each group ( total = 180 ) and immersed in distilled water ( control ), citric acid , lactic acid , and 75 % aqueous ethanol solution . the discs were removed after 24 h , 48 h , 72 h , 1 wk , 4 wk , and 12 wk . three groups of samples underwent thermocycling for 1000 , 2000 and 3000 cycles . the solutes were analyzed with hplc for detection of eluted monomers . the results showed that the amount of released tegdma was significantly higher than that of bis - gma ; however , there were not any significant differences between the amount of released bis - gma and udma . moreover , the highest amount of monomers was released from samples immersed in ethanol solution ; samples immersed in citric acid and lactic acid significantly released more monomers than those immersed in distilled water . furthermore , the immersion time in aqueous ethanol solution had an increasing effect on the release of monomers . in addition , the higher amounts of monomers were release from samples immersed in ethanol and citric acid which underwent a higher number of thermal cycles . in conclusion , food and drink stimulated liquids used in this study increased the amount of some of the monomers released from composite resin . thermal shocks and storage time are other factors that increased the release of monomers from the composite resin .	0
human exposure assessment to environmental chemicals using biomonitoring .. in modern societies , humans may be exposed to a wide spectrum of environmental chemicals . although the health significance of this exposure for many chemicals is unknown , studies to investigate the prevalence of exposure are warranted because of the chemicals ' potential harmful health effects , as often indicated in animal studies . three tools have been used to assess exposure : exposure history / questionnaire information , environmental monitoring , and biomonitoring ( i . e . measuring concentrations of the chemicals , their metabolites , or their adducts in human specimens ). we present an overview on the use of biomonitoring in exposure assessment using phthalates , bisphenol a and other environmental phenols , and perfluorinated chemicals as examples . we discuss some factors relevant for interpreting and understanding biomonitoring data , including selection of both biomarkers of exposure and human matrices , and toxicokinetic information . the use of biomonitoring in human risk assessment is not discussed .	0
bisphenol a suppresses osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities in the cultured scales of goldfish .. the direct effect of bisphenol a on osteoclasts and osteoblasts was examined using a culture system of goldfish scales . tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( trap ) and alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) were used as markers of osteoclasts and osteoblasts , respectively . bisphenol a ( 10 ( 5 ) m ) significantly suppressed both trap and alp activities . these data were reproduced in an in vivo experiment . from an analysis of a reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction in the in vitro - cultured scales , it was demonstrated that the insulin - like growth factor ( igf )- 1 mrna expression decreased by a bisphenol a treatment . on the other hand , 17beta - estradiol ( e ( 2 )) stimulated both trap and alp activities and did not change igf - 1 mrna expression , suggesting that bisphenol a has a different effect from e ( 2 ) on bone metabolism . this study is the first to demonstrate that bisphenol a functions to suppress directly osteoblasts and osteoclasts among vertebrates , which strongly suggests that this scale in an in vitro assay system can be utilized for the evaluation of the effects of endocrine disrupters on bone cells .	0
high volume individual fibre post versus low volume fibre post : the fracture load of the restored tooth .. objectives : the purpose of this study was to evaluate the fracture loads of post - and - core systems with two different individually formed fibre post designs and polymerization conditions . methods : totally seventy - two ( n = 8 / group ) bovine teeth were cut and made up the root length of 15 . 0mm . they were divided into 3 main groups ( group a , b , c ). a : one glass fibre post was light - cured before cementation , b : fibres were bundled to fill the entire root canal opening and light - cured before cementation , c : one unpolymerized glass fibre post was inserted into cement - filled root canal and light - cured with luting cement ( paracem ). moreover specimens of each group were divided into 3 subgroups according to the post length : subgroup 1 : 10mm ; subgroup 2 : 7 . 5mm ; subgroup 3 : 5 . 0mm . after cementation , the core was built up , and then made the composite resin crown ( filtek z250 ). fabricated specimen was loaded from 45 ° of palatal side at a crosshead speed of 1 . 0mm / min . the first load drop and maximum fracture loads were statistically analyzed by anova and tukey ' s test . results : maximum fracture load of group b ( 433 n ) and c ( 418 n ) are significantly higher than group a ( 284 n ) ( p < 0 . 01 ). short post ( 5mm ) provided higher fracture loads in all main groups , especially in group c . conclusions : using short and thick fibre post system ( the same diameter as the root canal ) showed higher strength than one fibre post only . in addition , by curing the cement and the fibre material simultaneously , the strength of the restored tooth was increased .	0

in vitro assay of hydrolysis and chlorohydroxy derivatives of bisphenol a diglycidyl ether for estrogenic activity .. bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) is an epoxy resin monomer . epoxy - based solution coatings are used in many applications as additives for a variety of plastic coatings in food packaging . it is well known that unreacted badge can migrate from epoxy - based packing materials into foods . not only badge but also its derivatives can easily migrate into foods and it is likely that we intake badge and its derivatives through food or drink . recently , endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) have attracted attention because they have been shown to affect reproduction in wildlife . the estrogenic activity of badge derivatives has not previously been investigated . therefore , we investigated the estrogenic activity of the badge derivatives , dihydrolysed badge ( badge - 4oh ) and chlorohydroxy badge ( badge - 2cl ), using breast cancer cell ( t47d ) proliferation assay and estrogen receptor ( er ) ( alpha ) binding assay . these chemicals exhibited t47d cell proliferation at concentrations of 10 (- 14 )- 10 (- 4 ) m . however , these chemicals did not bind to er ( alpha ) in the binding assay .	0
characterising humic acid fouling of nanofiltration membranes using bisphenol a as a molecular indicator .. fouling of nanofiltration ( nf ) membranes by humic acids was investigated using bisphenol a ( bpa ) as an indicator chemical to differentiate between various mechanisms that may lead to a change in solute rejection . three commercially available nf membranes were investigated and an accelerated fouling condition was achieved with a foulant mixture containing humic acids in an electrolyte matrix . the effects of membrane fouling on the rejection of bpa were interpreted with respect to the membrane pore sizes and the fouling characteristics . results reported here indicate that calcium concentration in the feed solution could be a major factor governing the humic acid fouling process . moreover , a critical concentration of calcium in the feed solution was observed , at which membrane fouling was most severe . membrane fouling characteristics were observed by their influence on bpa rejection . such influence could result in either an increase or decrease in rejection of bpa by the three different membranes depending on the rejection mechanisms involved . it is hypothesized that these mechanisms could occur simultaneously and that the effects of each might not be easily distinguished . however , it was observed that their relative contribution was largely dependent upon membrane pore size . pore blocking , which resulted in a considerable improvement in rejection , was prominent for the more open pore size tfc - sr2 membrane . in contrast , the cake - enhanced concentration polarisation effect was more severe for the tighter nf - 270 and nf - 90 membranes . for hydrophobic solutes such as bpa , the formation of the fouling layer could also interfere with the solute - membrane interaction , and therefore , exert considerable influence on the separation process .	0
microwave - assisted extraction for the simultaneous determination of novolac glycidyl ethers , bisphenol a diglycidyl ether , and its derivatives in canned food using hplc with fluorescence detection .. a microwave - assisted extraction ( mae ) protocol and an efficient hplc analysis method were first developed for the fast extraction and simultaneous determination of bisphenol f diglycidyl ether ( novolac glycidyl ether 2 - ring ), novolac glycidyl ether 3 - ring , novolac glycidyl ether 4 - ring , novolac glycidyl ether 5 - ring , novolac glycidyl ether 6 - ring , bisphenol a diglycidyl ether , bisphenol a ( 2 , 3 - dihydroxypropyl ) glycidyl ether , bisphenol a ( 3 - chloro - 2 - hydroxypropyl ) glycidyl ether , bisphenol a bis ( 3 - chloro - 2 - hydroxypropyl ) ether , bisphenol a ( 3 - chloro - 2 - hydroxypropyl ) ( 2 , 3 - dihydroxypropyl ) ether in canned fish and meat . after being optimized in terms of solvents , microwave power and irradiation time , mae was selected to carry out the extraction of ten target compounds . analytes were purified by poly ( styrene - co - divinylbenzene ) spe columns and determined by hplc - fluorescence detection . lod varied from 0 . 79 to 3 . 77 ng / g for different target compounds based on s / n = 3 ; loq were from 2 . 75 to 10 . 92 ng / g ; the rsd for repeatability were < 8 . 64 %. the analytical recoveries ranged from 70 . 46 to 103 . 44 %. this proposed method was successfully applied to 16 canned fish and meat , and the results acquired were in good accordance with the studies reported . compared with the conventional liquid - liquid extraction and ultrasonic extraction , the optimized mae approach gained the higher extraction efficiency ( 20 - 50 % improved ).	0
distribution of endocrine disruptors in the mondego river estuary , portugal .. recent studies in the mondego river estuary demonstrated signs of pollution in the area , but the nature of the contamination remains unexplored . because there seems to be any studies in that zone checking for the simultaneous presence of xenoestrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds , either of animal ( estradiol and estrone ), vegetal ( daidzein , genistein and biochanin a ), pharmaceutical ( 17alpha - ethynylestradiol ) or industrial ( bisphenol a , 4 - octylphenol , 4 - nonylphenol ) origins , the main objective of this study was to investigate their presence , in every year season and at eight points along the estuarine gradient . for this propose , water samples ( 2 l ) were collected in high and low tides , preconcentrated in the oasis hlb cartridges and cleaned in silica cartridges before their analysis by hplc - dad and gc - ms . the current data showed the absence of contamination by animal or pharmaceutical estrogens and by alkylphenols , but demonstrated the presence of high levels of phytoestrogens ( up to 1 . 1 mug / l ) and of bisphenol a ( up to 880 . 0 ng / l ). because these two chemicals existed in high environmental concentrations in the most upstream sampling station , and taking in account that these pollutants may additively contribute to endocrine disruption , namely on fish , it was concluded that at least this particularly area of the mondego estuary deserves continuous monitoring programmes .	0
effect of finishing time and techniques on marginal sealing ability of two composite restorative materials .. statement of problems : finishing of composites may adversely influence the sealing ability of direct adhesive restorations . purpose : this study was conducted to determine whether finishing time and techniques under wet or dry conditions affect the microleakage of 2 types of class v composite restorations . material and methods : eighty class v preparations were made in the buccal surfaces of noncarious molars with the occlusal margins ending in enamel and the gingival margins in dentin . dental adhesive ( single bond ) was applied according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . half of the preparations were restored with a microfilled composite ( silux plus ) and the other half with a hybrid composite ( filtek z250 ). within each major composite group ( n = 40 ), 4 subgroups ( n = 10 ) were established based on finishing technique ( diamond finishing burs or aluminum oxide discs ) and finishing time ( immediate or delayed by 24 hours ). the specimens were stored for 24 hours in 37 degrees c water , thermocycled for 250 cycles between 5 degrees c and 55 degrees c , immersed in 2 % methylene blue solution for another 24 hours , and sectioned longitudinally . for both enamel and dentin margins , dye solution penetration at the tooth / composite interface was scored from 0 to 4 under stereoscopy at original magnification x 20 . data were analyzed with the kruskal - wallis test ( p <. 05 ). results : significantly lower leakage scores were recorded for teeth restored with microfilled composite and finished under wet conditions after 24 hours ( p <. 01 ). no significant differences were found among the hybrid composite groups . conclusion : for microfilled composite restorations on dentin margins , delayed wet finishing with diamond burs resulted in significantly lower microleakage scores than all other finishing protocols . hybrid composite restorations had equivalent levels of microleakage regardless of the finishing method .	0
[ mineralization of bpa by combination of uv / h2o2 / micro - aeration process ].. the degradation and mineralization of bisphenol a ( bpa ) in water by uv / h2o2 / micro - aeration process were investigated . uv / h2o2 / micro - aeration is a new process developing from uv / h2o2 . a quantity of ozone appears when both micro - aeration and uv radiation exist , which enhances the productive rate of * oh . the effects of intensity of uv radiation , dosages of h2o2 and initial ph of the solution on mineralization of bpa by uv / h2o2 / micro - aeration process were studied . the results show that the mineralization rate of bpa increases linearly with the enhancement of intensity of uv radiation . when the dosages of h2o2 change from 5 mg / l to 20 mg / l , the constant ( k ) of mineralization rate rises from 0 . 003 2 to 0 . 025 0 . while ph is 6 . 68 , it can get the best effect of mineralization . under the same conditions the mineralization rate is much higher than its degradation rate . it ' s found that bpa is first degraded into smaller molecular organic matters , and the small molecular organic matters are further mineralized into inorganic matters gradually .	0
removal of bisphenol a from aqueous solution by a dodecylsulfate ion - intercalated hydrotalcite - like compound .. a mg - al hydrotalcite - like compound ( htlc ) and a dodecylsufate ion - intercalated mg - al htlc ( mhtlc ) were prepared . the effects of temperature , ionic strength , and initial ph on the adsorptions ofbisphenol a ( bpa ) on both htlc and mhtlc were studied in detail . the adsorption capacity of the pristine htlc for bpa was low , and the adsorption was due to the substitution of surface anions within the pristine htlc by the hydroxybenzene anion that was dissociated from bpa . the adsorption capacity for bpa increased notably with modification . the high adsorption capacity of mhtlc for bpa was mainly due to the dissolution of bpa molecules into the hydrophobic organic phase formed in the interlayers of mhtlc . the adsorption capacity of mhtlc for bpa decreased with increasing temperature and initial ph , but increased when increasing the ionic strength .	0
clinical evaluation of two adhesive composite cements for the suppression of dentinal cold sensitivity .. statement of problems : postoperative cold sensitivity after the cementation of indirect restorations with composite cements has been reported frequently but not scientifically documented . purpose : this controlled clinical study was designed to simulate the dentin / composite cement interface immediately after cementation of a cast restoration . the desensitizing capabilities of a composite cement that contains a self - etching , dual - polymerizing resin adhesive system were compared with those of a composite cement that use phosphoric acid etching followed by a single - bottle , light - activated primer / resin - based adhesive . material and methods : the hypersensitive root surfaces of selected teeth were randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments : coating with a self - etching adhesive ( linkmax ) and its respective cement , coating with a conventionally etched adhesive ( relyx arc ) and its cement , or no treatment ( negative control ). the sample size was 22 . dentin sensitivity was ascertained with an accurate cold testing device that slowly decreased in temperature . tooth sensitivity was measured both immediately and at 7 days after placement . two - way analysis of variance and fisher ' s least significant difference test ( p <. 05 ) were used to determine whether significant differences existed as a function of treatment type or time . results : immediately after placement , the self - etching adhesive and its respective cement resulted in more suppression of cold sensitivity than no treatment ( control ); with linkmax treatment , the temperature at which teeth responded was reduced by 8 . 4 degrees c . the conventionally etched adhesive and its cement reduced the temperature at which teeth responded by 9 . 4 degrees c . after 1 week , these temperature reductions were 7 . 0 degrees c and 4 . 3 degrees c , respectively . untreated controls at the 2 intervals showed a mean decrease in sensitivity to cold of 3 . 6 degrees c and 4 . 1 degrees c . statistical analysis showed type of composite cement to be a significant factor . conclusion : within the limitations of this study and in comparison to untreated control teeth , linkmax treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tooth root sensitivity over 1 week ( p =. 02 ), whereas relyx arc did not ( p =. 066 ).	0
resin - based composites and dentine - bonding agents . which , who and why ? a study in the east of scotland .. aims : to determine which resin - based composite ( rbc ) and dentine - bonding agent ( dba ) systems were most widely used by a random convenience sample of dentists in the east of scotland , by whom they were used , and what influenced the dentists ' choice when buying / using a particular rbc and dba . methods : a cross - sectional questionnaire - based study was conducted from june to december 2006 . a questionnaire was compiled and , following a short pilot and revision , 250 questionnaires were randomly distributed to dentists attending vocational training / general professional training study days , continuing education courses and various dental meetings . data from the completed questionnaires were collated and analysed . results : a total of 138 questionnaires were returned , giving a response rate of 55 %, of which 101 ( 73 %) were from practitioners working within the general dental services , 20 ( 14 %) from community dental service dentists , and 17 ( 12 %) from practitioners in the hospital dental service . the most popular rbc reported by respondents 43 ( 31 %) was z100 ( 3m uk , bracknell , uk ). the most common factors that influenced respondents ' choice when buying an rbc were ease of use and availability , reported by 51 ( 37 %) and 45 ( 33 %) respondents , respectively . prime & bond ( dentsply detrey , konstanz , germany ) was reported as the most popular dba by 58 ( 42 %) respondents . overall , availability , reported by 61 ( 44 %) respondents , was the most popular reason for choice of a dba , followed by ease of use , reported by 52 ( 38 %) respondents , and reliability , reported by 23 ( 17 %) respondents . conclusions : the most popular rbcs and dbas used by respondents to this study and common reasons for their use were identified . however , it was found that , among those who responded , there was no discernible relationship between undergraduate training , year of qualification and choice of material . further research is required to corroborate these findings and to identify the level of understanding of material science by dental clinicians .	0
developmental and metabolic brain alterations in rats exposed to bisphenol a during gestation and lactation .. in recent years , considerable research has focused on the biological effect of endocrine - disrupting chemicals . bisphenol a ( bpa ) has been implicated as an endocrine - disrupting chemical ( edc ) due to its ability to mimic the action of endogenous estrogenic hormones . the aim of this study was to assess the effect of perinatal exposure to bpa on cerebral structural development and metabolism after birth . bpa ( 1mg / l ) was administered in the drinking water of pregnant dams from day 6 of gestation until pup weaning . at postnatal day 20 , in vivo metabolite concentrations in the rat pup hippocampus were measured using high field proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy . further , brain was assessed histologically for growth , gross morphology , glial and neuronal development and extent of myelination . localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (( 1 ) h mrs ) showed in the bpa - exposed rat a significant increase in glutamate concentration in the hippocampus as well as in the glu / asp ratio . interestingly these two metabolites are metabolically linked together in the malate - aspartate metabolic shuttle . quantitative histological analysis revealed that the density of neun - positive neurons in the hippocampus was decreased in the bpa - treated offspring when compared to controls . conversely , the density of gfap - positive astrocytes in the cingulum was increased in bpa - treated offspring . in conclusion , exposure to low - dose bpa during gestation and lactation leads to significant changes in the glu / asp ratio in the hippocampus , which may reflect impaired mitochondrial function and also result in neuronal and glial developmental alterations .	0
comparison of resolution in microemulsion ekc and mekc employing suppressed electroosmosis : application to bisphenol - a - diglycidyl ether and its derivatives .. the resolution ( r ( s )) of hydrophobic analytes in microemulsion ekc ( meekc ) and mekc with suppressed electroosmosis was investigated using bisphenol - a - diglycidyl ether and its derivatives ( badges ) as test analytes . separation scales were compared using our equation for the resolution , r ( s )= ( square rootn / 4 )( alpha - 1 )/( 1 + k ( 2 )), where k is the retention factor , alpha the selectivity ( alpha = k ( 2 )/ k ( 1 ) for k ( 2 ) > or = k ( 1 )> 0 ), and n the average efficiency . at given concentrations of sds and organic cosolvent in the buffer , in comparison with mekc , meekc was found to provide better resolution of badges , mainly due to the significantly smaller k in meekc , but not the greater alpha in meekc , while a comparable range of n . significantly improved resolution of badges was obtained with increase in the concentration of organic cosolvent in the meekc and mekc buffers , while small change in r ( s ) with the sds concentration in a range of 100 - 180 mm . in addition , a decrease in temperature or voltage resulted in slightly better r ( s ).	0
improving performance of dental resins by adding titanium dioxide nanoparticles .. objective : the objective of this study is to improve the performance of dental resins by adding a small amount of titanium dioxide nanoparticles ( tio₂ nps ), which have outstanding mechanical properties and unique photoactivities . methods : acrylic acid modified tio₂ nps ( ap25 ) were prepared and added to a mixture of bis - phenol - a - dimethacrylate and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( mass ratio 1 : 1 ) at seven mass fractions . disks made of these resins were subjected to ftir microspectroscopy , nanoindentation , microindentation , and 3 - point bending to determine the degree of vinyl conversion ( dc ) modulus and hardness . the shear bond strengths ( sbs ) of dentin adhesives containing various amount of ap25 were also examined . results : the dc increased as a function of mass fraction of ap25 and reached a plateau at 0 . 1 %. the dc of the resin mixture was improved by ≈ 7 % up to 91 . 7 ± 0 . 8 %. the elastic modulus and hardness of the composites increased initially as more ap25 were added , and decreased after reached the maximum value at approximately 0 . 06 % mass fraction of ap25 . the maximum elastic modulus was ≈ 48 % higher than that of the np - free resin , and the maximum hardness was more than twice higher than that of the np - free resin . using these resin composites as dental adhesives , the mean sbs using resins with 0 . 1 % mass fraction of ap25 was ≈ 30 % higher than those using np - free resin . significance : by adding a small amount of ap25 to the resin , the dc and the mechanical properties of resins were improved dramatically . these findings could lead to better performing dental adhesives .	0
perinatal bisphenol a exposure and adult glucose homeostasis : identifying critical windows of exposure .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a widespread endocrine - disrupting chemical used as the building block for polycarbonate plastics . epidemiological evidence has correlated bpa exposure with higher risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes . however , it remains unknown whether there are critical windows of susceptibility to bpa exposure on the development of dysglycemia . this study was an attempt to investigate the critical windows and the long - term consequences of perinatal exposure to bpa on glucose homeostasis . pregnant mice were given either vehicle or bpa ( 100 µg / kg / day ) at different time of perinatal stage : 1 ) on days 1 - 6 of pregnancy ( p1 - p6 , preimplantation exposure ); 2 ) from day 6 of pregnancy until postnatal day ( pnd ) 0 ( p6 - pnd0 , fetal exposure ); 3 ) from lactation until weaning ( pnd0 - pnd21 , neonatal exposure ); and 4 ) from day 6 of gestation until weaning ( p6 - pnd21 , fetal and neonatal exposure ). at 3 , 6 and 8 months of age , offspring in each group were challenged with glucose and insulin tolerance tests . then islet morphometry and β - cell function were measured . the glucose homeostasis was impaired in p6 - pnd0 mice from 3 to 6 months of age , and this continued to 8 months in males , but not females . while in pnd0 - pnd21 and p6 - pnd21 bpa - treated groups , only the 3 - month - old male offspring developed glucose intolerance . moreover , at the age of 3 months , perinatal exposure to bpa resulted in the increase of β - cell mass mainly due to the coordinate changes in cell replication , neogenesis , and apoptosis . the alterations of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity , rather than β - cell mass , were consistent with the development of glucose intolerance . our findings suggest that bpa may contribute to metabolic disorders relevant to glucose homeostasis and the effects of bpa were dose , sex , and time - dependent . fetal development stage may be the critical window of susceptibility to bpa exposure .	0
effects of conventional and high - intensity light - curing on enamel shear bond strength of composite resin and resin - modified glass - ionomer .. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the shear bond strengths of a composite resin ( transbond xt ; 3m / unitek , monrovia , calif ) and a resin - modified glass ionomer ( fuji ortho lc ; gc america inc , alsip , ill ) cured with 2 different light - curing units : a conventional visible light unit ( ortholux xt ; 3m dental products , st paul , minn ) and a xenon arc light unit ( plasma arc curing [ pac ] system ; american dental technologies , corpus christi , texas ). one hundred twenty freshly extracted bovine permanent mandibular incisors were randomly divided into 1 of 8 groups ; each group consisted of 15 specimens . two groups ( 1 group for each type of adhesive ) were exposed to the visible light for 20 seconds ( transbond xt ) and 40 seconds ( fuji ortho lc ), respectively , and used as control groups . the remaining 6 groups ( 3 for each adhesive ) were cured with the xenon arc light for 2 , 5 , and 10 seconds . after bonding , all samples were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hours and subsequently tested in a shear mode on an instron universal testing machine ( instron corp , canton , mass ). for the groups bonded with transbond xt , no statistically significant differences ( p =. 868 ) were found between the shear bond strength of the control group cured with ortholux xt and those of the groups cured with the pac system for 2 , 5 , or 10 seconds . when the shear bond strengths of the groups bonded with fuji ortho lc were evaluated , no statistically significant differences ( p =. 087 ) were found between the control group that was cured with ortholux xt and those cured with the pac system . the bond strength of the composite resin was significantly higher than that of the resin - modified glass ionomer in all the groups tested ( p <. 0001 ). the present findings indicate that , compared with visible light - curing , the xenon arc light enables the clinician to significantly reduce the curing time of both bonding agents , without affecting their shear bond strengths . therefore , xenon arc light sources can be recommended as an advantageous alternative for curing both composite resins and resin - modified glass ionomers .	0
effects of neonatal treatment with 6 - hydroxydopamine and endocrine disruptors on motor activity and gene expression in rats .. to investigate the mechanisms underlying motor hyperactivity , we performed intracisternal injection of 6 - hydroxydopamine or endocrine disruptors in rats on postnatal day 5 . 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 100 microg , 488 nmol ) caused a significant increase in spontaneous motor activities at 4 weeks of age . gene - expression profiling using a cdna membrane array revealed alterations in several classes of gene at 8 weeks of age . in the midbrain , gene expression was enhanced in dopamine transporter 1 ; a platelet - derived growth factor receptor ; dopamine receptor d4 ; galanin receptor 2 ; arginine vasopressin receptor 2 ; neuropeptide y ; tachykinin 2 ; and fibroblast growth factor 10 . expression was also enhanced in the glutamate / aspartate transporter gene in the striatum . rats received an endocrine disruptor ( 87 nmol ), such as bisphenol a , nonylphenol , p - octylphenol , or diethylhexylphthalate , which also caused motor hyperactivity at 4 weeks . the effects of bisphenol a on motor activity were dose - dependent from 0 . 87 to 87 nmol . the phenols caused a deficit in dopamine neurons , similarly to the deficit caused by 6 - hydroxydopamine . gene - expression profiles after treatment with endocrine disruptors showed variation and differed from those of 6 - hydroxydopamine . the results suggest that neonatal treatment with environmental chemicals can generate an animal model of attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder , in which clinical symptoms are pervasive .	0
the effect of dentin surface moisture on bond strength to dentin bonding agents .. this in vitro study compares the mean shear bond strengths of two dentin bonding agents to dry and to moist human dentin . the occlusal surfaces of 60 extracted human molars were ground to produce flat dentin surfaces . the teeth were divided into four groups of 15 specimens each . for scotchbond multi - purpose dentin bonding agent , the teeth were etched , rinsed , and then either blotted with gauze , which left the dentin moist , or dried with compressed air . the primer and adhesive were then applied , and composite cylinders were bonded to the teeth . for optibond , the teeth were again either blotted with gauze or dried with air . the primer and dual - activated adhesive were applied , and composite cylinders were bonded to the teeth . after storage in room - temperature distilled water for 48 hours , the specimens were thermocycled . shear bond strength testing was performed at 1 week . analysis using two - sample t - tests found no significant difference for either product in bond strengths to moist and to dry dentin ( p > 0 . 05 ). this study indicated that for some current - generation dentin bonding agents , the presence of moisture on dentin surfaces does not compromise short - term bond strength .	0
effect of immediate dentin sealing on preventive treatment for postcementation hypersensitivity .. purpose : the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of prime and bond adhesive on preventing postcementation hypersensitivity of vital abutment teeth restored with a full - coverage restoration using the immediate dentin sealing ( ids ) technique . materials and methods : twenty - five male patients received 25 three - unit fixed partial dentures . a split - mouth design was used and two vital abutment teeth in each patient were allocated randomly into groups a or b . teeth in group a were treated with prime and bond using the ids technique while teeth in group b were used as a control and left untreated . the discomfort interval scale , ranging from 0 to 4 , was adopted to evaluate hypersensitivity . the double - blind method was applied during the operation so that neither the patient nor the clinician knew which abutment had been treated . the sensitivity assessment was performed 1 week , and 1 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months after cementation . results were analyzed using the sign test . results : scores for teeth in group a were statistically significantly lower than those in group b at 1 week and 1 month postcementation ( p < . 05 ), whereas there was no significant difference between groups a and b at the end of 6 , 12 , and 24 months ( p > . 05 ). conclusion : preventive treatment with prime and bond using the ids technique can significantly reduce postcementation hypersensitivity . int j prosthodont 2010 ; 23 : 49 - 52 .	0

time - based elution of tegdma and bisgma from resin composite cured with led , qth and high - intensity qth lights .. this study measured the elution of tegdma and bisgma monomers from hybrid , micro - filled resin composites over 72 hours at different time intervals after polymerization with standard quartz - tungsten - halogen ( qth ), high - intensity fast - curing qth and standard blue light emitting diode ( led ) light units . samples were polymerized from the top and bottom surfaces , then immersed in methanol . high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) was used to measure the amount of monomers released from the samples at various time intervals , ranging from 0 to 72 hours ( 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 , 48 and 72 hours ). data was analyzed using two - way anova and duncan tests with a significance level of 0 . 05 . no significant differences were observed among curing groups in the elution of tegdma monomers at 0 , 9 , 12 , 24 , 48 and 72 hours ; whereas , significant differences were observed among curing groups at 3 and 6 hours . bisgma elution in samples immersed for longer periods ( 9 - 72 hours ) were significantly higher than samples immersed for shorter time periods ( 0 - 6 hours ); however , 72 hours appeared to be too short a period for the total elution of bisgma into methanol .	0
one - step derivatization and preconcentration microextraction technique for determination of bisphenol a in beverage samples by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry .. a simple technique based on ultrasound - assisted emulsification microextraction in situ derivatization ( usaeme - isd ) is proposed for the one - step derivatization , extraction , and preconcentration of bisphenol a ( bpa ) in beverage samples prior to gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ) analysis . bpa was in situ derivatized with acetic anhydride and simultaneously extracted and preconcentrated by using usaeme . variables affecting the extraction efficiency of bpa were evaluated . under optimal experimental conditions , the detection limit ( lod ) was 38 ng l (- 1 ) with a relative standard deviation ( rsd ) value of 11 . 6 %. the linear working range was 100 - 1250 ng l (- 1 ), and the coefficient of estimation ( r ( 2 )) of the calibration curve was ≥ 0 . 9971 . the robustness of the proposed methodology was probed by developing a recovery study at two concentrations ( 125 and 500 ng l (- 1 )) over different beverage samples . this study led to a satisfactory result achieving recoveries of ≥ 82 %, which showed acceptable robustness for determination of nanograms per liter of bpa in samples of food safety interest .	0
effects of secondary curing on indirect posterior composite resins .. this study was designed to compare strength , elastic modulus ( stiffness ), and hardness for five composite resin materials that are used for laboratory - fabricated posterior composite restorations . ten specimens of each material were processed according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . statistical analysis indicated that there were significant differences in mechanical properties among the materials tested . in addition , materials that are incrementally light cured prior to secondary processing were tested for changes in mechanical properties following secondary processing . it was determined that secondary processing provided improvement in flexural strength ( 11 %) when compared to samples that were only light cured .	0
effect of an acidic primer on shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets .. a unique characteristic of some new etching systems is that they combine the conditioning and priming agents into a single acidic primer solution . the purpose of this study was to determine the effects on the shear bond strength and the bracket / adhesive failure mode when an acidic primer and other enamel etchants were used to condition the enamel surface before bonding . the brackets were bonded to extracted human teeth according to one of four protocols following the manufacturers instructions . group i , teeth were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid , the brackets were then bonded with system 1 + adhesive ( ormco corporation . orange , calif .); group ii , teeth were etched with 10 % maleic acid , the brackets were also bonded with system 1 + adhesive ; group iii , an acidic primer that contains both the acid ( phenyl - p ) and the primer ( hema and dimethacrylate ) were placed on the enamel for 30 seconds . the adhesive used on this group was a lightly filled resin that contains bis - gma and hema . ( clearfil liner bond 2 . j . c . moritta , kuraway , japan ); group iv , the same acidic primer was used as in group ii , the adhesive used was highly filled ( panavia 21 . j . c . moritta ) and contains bis - gma . the present in vitro findings indicated that the use of acidic primers to bond orthodontic brackets to the enamel surface could provide clinically acceptable shear bond forces ( x = 10 . 4 +/- 4 . 4 mpa ) when used with a highly ( 77 %) filled adhesive ( panavia 21 ). these debonding forces were comparable to those obtained when the enamel was conditioned with either phosphoric ( x = 11 . 8 +/- 4 . 1 mpa ) or maleic ( x = 10 . 9 +/- 4 . 4 mpa ) acids . with the use of a lightly ( 10 %) filled adhesive ( clearfil liner bond 2 ), the shear bond strength was significantly lower ( x = 5 . 9 +/- 5 . 6 mpa ). it is of interest to note that there was a tendency to have less residual adhesive remaining on the tooth when an acid primer was used than when phosphoric and maleic acids were used . this might be of advantage to the clinician because it will require less time to clean the teeth after debonding .	0
in vitro evaluation of giomers microleakage after exposure to 33 % hydrogen peroxide : self - etch vs total - etch adhesives .. this study evaluated the microleakage of a giomer resin bonded with total - etch and self - etch adhesive systems after exposure to hydrogen peroxide . thirty freshly extracted , caries - free human premolars and molars were used . the teeth were randomly divided into two groups : group i was exposed to 33 % hydrogen peroxide ( niveous - shofu ) for 30 minutes daily for five consecutive days ; group ii received no treatment ( control ). a week later , class v standardized preparations were performed on the facial and lingual surfaces , with the gingival margin placed 1 mm below the cej . each group was then divided into two subgroups : in groups ia and iia , a self - etching adhesive system ( fl bond - shofu ) was applied , and in groups ib and iib , a total - etch adhesive system ( prime bond nt - dentsply / caulk ) was applied according to manufacturers ' instructions . the teeth were restored using 2 - mm increments of beautifil a2 resin - based giomer material ( shofu ). each layer was cured using a spectrum 800 curing light ( dentsply / caulk ) for 20 seconds at 600mw / cm2 . the teeth were thermocycled 500x between 5 degrees c and 55 degrees c with a dwell of 30 seconds ; they were then placed in a 0 . 5 % methylene blue dye solution for 24 hours at 37 degrees c . samples were sectioned longitudinally and evaluated for microleakage at the occlusal and gingival margin under a stereomicroscope at 20x magnification . dye penetration was scored using the following scoring system 0 = no penetration ; 1 = partial dye penetration along the occlusal or gingival wall ; 2 = partial dye penetration along the occlusal or gingival wall but did not include the axial wall ; 3 = dye penetration to and along the axial wall . a mann - whitney test revealed a statistically significant difference between subgroups at the occlusal level ( p < 0 . 0001 ). group ia yielded the most microleakage . no statistically significant difference was reported at the gingival level . microleakage was affected by hydrogen peroxide exposure only at the enamel cavosurface margin when a self - etching primer adhesive system was used .	0
a mode - of - action approach for the identification of genotoxic carcinogens .. distinguishing between clastogens and aneugens is vital in cancer risk assessment because the default assumption is that clastogens and aneugens have linear and non - linear dose - response curves , respectively . any observed non - linearity must be supported by mode of action ( moa ) analyses where biological mechanisms are linked with dose - response evaluations . for aneugens , the moa has been well characterised as disruptors of mitotic machinery where chromosome loss via micronuclei ( mn ) formation is an accepted endpoint used in risk assessment . in this study we performed the cytokinesis - block micronucleus assay and immunofluorescence mitotic machinery visualisation in human lymphoblastoid ( ahh - 1 ) and chinese hamster fibroblast ( v79 ) cell lines after treatment with the aneugen 17 - β - oestradiol ( e₂ ). results were compared to previously published data on bisphenol - a ( bpa ) and rotenone data . two concentration - response approaches ( the threshold -[ td ] and benchmark - dose [ bmd ] approaches ) were applied to derive a point of departure ( pod ) for in vitro mn induction . bmds were also derived from the most sensitive carcinogenic endpoint . ranking comparisons of the pods from the in vitro mn and the carcinogenicity studies demonstrated a link between these two endpoints for bpa , e₂ and rotenone . this analysis was extended to include 5 additional aneugens , 5 clastogens and 3 mutagens and further concentration and dose - response correlations were observed between pods from the in vitro mn and carcinogenicity . this approach is promising and may be further extended to other genotoxic carcinogens , where moa and quantitative information from the in vitro mn studies could be used in a quantitative manner to further inform cancer risk assessment .	0
influence of thermal and mechanical load cycling on microtensile bond strengths of total and self - etching adhesive systems .. this study evaluated the influence of different thermal ( tc ) and mechanical ( mc ) cycling protocols on microtensile bond strength ( mutbs ) to cervical dentin margins of class ii restorations using two total - etch ( te ) adhesives and one self - etching ( se ) primer . class ii slot cavities were prepared on the mesial surfaces of 168 bovine incisors and were divided into three groups according to the bonding system used : single bond , optibond solo plus and clearfil se bond . all cavities were restored with filtek z250 composite . following restorative procedures , the restored teeth were allocated to seven subgroups ( n = 8 ) according to the thermal / mechanical protocol performed : g1 - control ( no cycling ), g2 - 100 , 000 mc , g3 - 200 , 000 mc , g4 - 500 , 000 mc , g5 - 100 , 000 mc + 1 , 000 tc , g6 - 200 , 000 mc + 1 , 000 tc , g7 - 500 , 000 mc + 1 , 000 tc . tc was performed using 5 +/- 2 degrees c and 55 +/- 2 degrees c baths , with a dwell time of 60 seconds in each bath . mc was achieved with an axial force of 80 n at 2 cycles / second . the restorations were sectioned perpendicular to the cervical bonded interface into two 0 . 8 - 1 - mm thick slabs . the slabs were trimmed at the interface to obtain a cross - sectional surface area of 0 . 8 - 1 mm2 . all specimens were then subjected to mutbs ( v = 0 . 5 mm / minute ). fracture mode analysis was performed using sem . bond strength mean values ( mpa ) were analyzed with anova 3 - way and tukey ' s test ( alpha = 5 %). dunnett ' s test was used to compare tested groups against control groups of each adhesive system ( alpha = 56 %). se primer presented lower mean bond strength values when compared to te adhesives ( p = 0 . 05 ). in addition , specimens restored with the se primer did not resist to the 200 , 000 and 500 , 000 mc associated with tc . the application of 100 , 000 mc did not present a significant decrease in bond strength when compared to the control . mixed failures were predominant for all groups . the higher the amount of thermal / mechanical cycles , the greater the number of mixed failures and the lower the percentage of adhesive failures .	0
comparison of an array of in vitro assays for the assessment of the estrogenic potential of natural and synthetic estrogens , phytoestrogens and xenoestrogens .. many chemicals in surface waters and sediments have recently been discovered to have estrogenic / antiestrogenic activity . among these compounds , known as ' endocrine disrupters ', are natural and synthetic hormones , phytoestrogenes and a variety of industrial chemicals , such as certain detergents and pesticides . these substances are supposed to affect the development and reproduction in wildlife and humans and may also be involved in the induction of cancer . in order to assess the estrogenic / antiestrogenic potential of pure compounds and complex environmental samples we compared an array of in vitro test systems , ( i ) two luciferase reporter gene assays using transgenic human mvln cells ( derived from mcf - 7 cells ) and hgeln cells ( derived from hela cells ); ( ii ) a competitive binding assay with recombinant human estrogen receptors ( er ) alpha and beta ; and ( iii ) a proliferation assay with mcf7 - cells ( e - screen ). the sensitivity of the assays for 17 - beta - estradiol decreased in the order : mvln - cells = e - screen > hgeln - cells > binding to er - alpha > binding to er - beta . a good correlation was obtained between the estrogenic potencies of 11 compounds ( 17 - beta - estradiol ( e ( 2 )), estrone ( e ( 1 )), estriol ( e ( 3 )), ethinylestradiol ( ee ( 2 )), diethylstilbestrol ( des ), coumestrol , beta - sitosterol , genistein , 4 - nonylphenol , 4 - octylphenol , bisphenol a ) in the three tissue culture assays . the relative potencies of the compounds obtained by the cell free binding assays were one to two orders of magnitude higher compared with the cell culture assays . the phytoestrogens showed a preference to bind to er - beta , but only genistein showed a much lower activity in the e - screen ( growth induction in breast cancer cells ) compared with the luciferase induction in mvln and hgeln - cells .	0
synthetic polymers adsorbing bisphenol a and its analogues prepared by covalent molecular imprinting using bisphenol a dimethacrylate as a template molecule .. synthetic polymers which can adsorb bisphenol a ( bpa ) and related compounds were prepared by a covalent molecular imprinting technique . bpa dimethacrylate , used as template molecule , was polymerized with a crosslinker , triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ) or trimethylol propane trimethacrylate ( trim ). after the polymerization treatment with dilute naoh was used to cleave bpa from the polymers . for high recovery of bpa with low polymer matrix degradation , the hydrolysis conditions were determined to be treatment with 1 . 0 mol l (- 1 ) naoh for 48 h . the binding sites generated by the hydrolysis were evaluated by determination of the retentivity of bpa , bpa analogues , and other endocrine disruptors . the polymers strongly adsorbed compounds with two hydroxyl groups at the 4 , 4 '- positions . generally the tegdma - based polymers had stronger affinity than the trim - based polymers , although the trim - based polymer adsorbed steroidal hormones with two hydroxyl groups , for example 17 alpha - estradiol and 17 beta - estradiol , more strongly than the tegdma - based polymer , meaning that the crosslinkers affected the properties of the binding sites and , depending upon the target molecules , suitable crosslinkers should be chosen in this system .	0
estrogenic potential of the venice , italy , lagoon waters .. the exposure of the venice lagoon ( italy ) to endocrine - disrupting compounds ( edcs ) from different sources was investigated . spatial and time distribution of edc concentrations were determined in four sampling sessions ( december 2001 - may 2002 ) by solid phase extraction followed by high - performance liquid chromatography separation coupled with mass spectrometry detection via electrospray interface ( spe - hplc - esi - ms ), which allowed identification of natural ( estradiol , estrone ) and synthetic estrogenic compounds , both steroidal ( ethinylestradiol , mestranol ) and nonsteroidal ( benzophenone , bisphenol - a , nonylphenol , nonylphenol monoethoxylate carboxylate ). no significant differences in the edc distribution were observed between stations located near selected sources ( raw sewage from the historical center of venice , treated municipal and industrial effluents from sewage treatment plants , and areas undergoing the inflow of rivers ). while synthetic nonsteroidal analytes were recorded in the 1 to 1040 ng / l range ( average concentration : 34 ng / l ), steroidal edc ( estradiol , ethinylestradiol ) concentrations were lower ( 1 - 125 ng / l ; average concentration : 8 ng / l ). the estrogenic activity of lagoon waters was estimated in terms of estradiol equivalent concentration ( eeq ) by applying the estradiol equivalency factors ( eefs ). steroidal edcs ( estradiol , ethinylestradiol ) contributed > 97 % to the total potential estrogenicity of the waters , which accounted for 4 to 172 ng / l ( average : 25 ng / l ), as total eeqs . these levels are likely to pose adverse effects on the venice lagoon aquatic organisms .	0
effect of primer precuring on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets .. two adhesive systems , transbond apc ii ( 3m unitek , monrovia , calif ) and quick cure ( reliance orthodontic products , itasca , ill ), were used to determine the efficacy of precuring the liquid resin primer phase of the systems to increase shear bond strength . one hundred sixty bovine incisors were divided into groups of 20 specimens . in 1 group , the primer was cured before placement of the bracket with the filled adhesive material , and , in the other group , the primer was not precured . the shear - peel bond strength was tested with a testing machine at 30 minutes and 24 hours . no statistically significant difference in bond strength was found between the groups that had or had not been precured . more adhesive remained on the teeth with the transbond when the primer was not precured . there is no advantage or disadvantage in bracket bond strength by precuring the primer before placing the bracket and filled component of the adhesive .	0
dentin bond strength : influence of er : yag and nd : yag lasers .. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of er : yag and nd : yag lasers on the shear bond strength of composite resin to dentin . the coronal portion of 56 human molars was divided into three parts , and the dentin thickness was standardized at 2 mm . a 3 - mm hole was marked in the center of each tooth with sealing tape paper . the specimens ( n = 14 ) were then divided into four groups : ( 1 ) acid etching + single bond ( sb ) ( control ), ( 2 ) acid etching + sb + nd : yag laser irradiation ( before adhesive curing ), ( 3 ) thermal etching with the er : yag laser + sb , and ( 4 ) thermal etching with the er : yag laser + sb + nd : yag laser irradiation ( before adhesive curing ). a composite resin cylinder was built into the delimited area for conducting the shear bond strength test on the universal testing machine . the means ± standard deviations were : group 1 , 17 . 05 ± 4 . 15 mpa ; group 2 , 16 . 90 ± 3 . 36 mpa ; group 3 , 12 . 12 ± 3 . 85 mpa ; and group 4 , 12 . 92 ± 2 . 73 mpa . groups 1 and 2 presented significantly higher values than groups 3 and 4 . it was concluded that conventional etching with 37 % phosphoric acid yielded significantly higher bond strength values compared to thermal etching with the er : yag laser . the nd : yag laser did not significantly influence the bond strength .	0

simultaneous determination of bisphenol - a - diglycidyl ether , bisphenol - f - diglycidyl ether , and their derivatives in oil - in - water and aqueous - based canned foods by high - performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection .. a gradient reversed - phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection method for simultaneous identification and quantification of bisphenol - a - diglycidyl ether ( badge ), bisphenol - f - diglycidyl ether ( bfdge ), and their 10 derivatives in food matrixes was developed and validated for the analysis of oil - in - water - and aqueous - based foodstuffs . the method linearity range 0 . 016 - 10 ppm which are hundred - fold below and tenfold above the eu restriction at 1 ppm ( mg / kg ). the method detection limits range 0 . 72 - 4 . 20 ppb and the method quantitation limits range 2 . 40 - 14 . 85 ppb , respectively . the validation data indicate excellent precision , acceptable recovery , and good robustness , all supporting a good potential to further develop the method as a standard method for the determination of migrations from interior can coatings into foodstuffs .	0
novel surface modified molecularly imprinted polymer focused on the removal of interference in environmental water samples for chromatographic determination .. uniformly sized molecularly imprinted polymers ( mips ) for bisphenol a ( bpa ) with surface modification and immobilized intervals of functional monomers afforded by utilizing 4 , 4 '- methylenebisphenol as a pseudo component have been prepared . mips for bpa were prepared using 4 - vinyl pyridine immobilized in the most effective interval and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as a functional monomer and cross - linking agent , respectively . prepared mips showed significant selectivity for bpa retention and removal performance for interference in actual samples as the hplc stationary phase compared to those of ordinary mips . these mips were employed as pretreatment media of column switching hplc and the hplc system provided a detection limit of 0 . 36 ppt when electrochemical detection was used . actual samples , including suwannee river natural organic matter ( nom ), were applied and bpa was detected in the nom even if widely used uv detection was employed .	0
gene expression profile induced by 17alpha - ethynyl estradiol , bisphenol a , and genistein in the developing female reproductive system of the rat .. exposure to some compounds with estrogenic activity , during fetal development , has been shown to alter development of reproductive organs , leading to abnormal function and disease either after birth or during adulthood . in order to understand the molecular events associated with the estrogenicity of different chemicals and to determine whether common sets of gene expression changes can be predictive of estrogenic activity , we have used microarray technology to determine the transcriptional program influenced by exposure to this class of compounds during organogenesis and development . changes in patterns of gene expression were determined in the developing uterus and ovaries of sprague - dawley rats on gd 20 , exposed to graded dosages ( sc ) of 17alpha - ethynyl estradiol ( ee ), genistein , or bisphenol a ( bpa ) from gd 11 to gd 20 . dose levels were roughly equipotent in estrogenic activity . we compared the transcript profiles between treatment groups and controls , using oligonucleotide arrays to determine the expression level of approximately 7000 rat genes and over 1000 expressed squence tags ( ests ). at the highest tested doses of ee , bpa , or genistein , we determined that less than 2 % of the mrna detected by the array showed a 2 - fold or greater change in their expression level ( increase or decrease ). a dose - dependent analysis of the transcript profile revealed a common set of genes whose expression is significantly and reproducibly modified in the same way by each of the 3 chemicals tested . additionally , each compound induces changes in the expression of other transcripts that are not in common with the others , which indicated not all compounds with estrogenic activity act alike . the results of this study demonstrate that transplacental exposure to chemicals with estrogenic activity changes the gene expression profile of estrogen - sensitive tissues , and that the analysis of the transcript profile of these tissues could be a valuable approach to determining the estrogenicity of different compounds .	0
anti - thyroid hormonal activity of tetrabromobisphenol a , a flame retardant , and related compounds : affinity to the mammalian thyroid hormone receptor , and effect on tadpole metamorphosis .. the thyroid hormone - disrupting activity of tetrabromobisphenol a ( tbbpa ), a flame retardant , and related compounds was examined . tbbpa , tetrachlorobisphenol a ( tcbpa ), tetramethylbisphenol a ( tmbpa ) and 3 , 3 '- dimethylbisphenol a ( dmbpa ) markedly inhibited the binding of triiodothyronine ( t3 ; 1 x 10 (- 10 ) m ) to thyroid hormone receptor in the concentration range of 1 x 10 (- 7 )- 1 x 10 (- 4 ) m , while bisphenol a and 2 , 2 - diphenylpropane were inactive . tbbpa , tcbpa , tmbpa and dmbpa did not exhibit thyroid hormonal activity in a thyroid hormone - responsive reporter assay using a chinese hamster ovary cell line ( cho - k1 ) transfected with thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 or beta1 , but tbbpa and tcbpa showed significant anti - thyroid hormone effects on the activity of t3 ( 1 x 10 (- 8 ) m ) in the concentration range of 3 x 10 (- 6 ) - 5 x 10 (- 5 ) m . the thyroid hormone - disrupting activity of tbbpa was also examined in terms of the effect on amphibian metamorphosis stimulated by thyroid hormone . tbbpa in the concentration range of 1 x 10 (- 8 ) to 1 x 10 (- 6 ) m showed suppressive action on t3 ( 5 x 10 (- 8 ) m )- enhancement of rana rugosa tadpole tail shortening . these facts suggest that tbbpa , tcbpa , tmbpa and dmbpa can act as thyroid hormone - disrupting agents .	0
perinatal exposure to low doses of bisphenol a affects body weight , patterns of estrous cyclicity , and plasma lh levels .. the nonsteroidal estrogenic compound bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a monomer used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and resins . bpa may be ingested by humans as it reportedly leaches from the lining of tin cans into foods , from dental sealants into saliva , and from polycarbonate bottles into their contents . because bpa is weakly estrogenic -- approximately 10 , 000 - fold less potent than 17beta - estradiol -- current environmental exposure levels have been considered orders of magnitude below the dose required for adverse effects on health . herein we demonstrate measurable effects on the offspring of sprague - dawley female rats that were exposed , via their drinking water , to approximately 0 . 1 mg bpa / kg body weight ( bw )/ day ( low dose ) or 1 . 2 mg bpa / kg bw / day ( high dose ) from day 6 of pregnancy through the period of lactation . offspring exposed to bpa exhibited an increase in body weight that was apparent soon after birth and continued into adulthood . in addition , female offspring exposed perinatally to the high dose of bpa exhibited altered patterns of estrous cyclicity and decreased levels of plasma luteinizing hormone ( lh ) in adulthood . administration of neither the doses of bpa that caused effects during perinatal exposure nor a 10 - fold higher dose was able to evoke a uterotropic response in ovariectomized postpubertal females . these data indicate an increased sensitivity to bpa during the perinatal period and suggest the need for careful evaluation of the current levels of exposure to this compound .	0
optimization of a yeast estrogen screen and its applicability to study the release of estrogenic isoflavones from a soygerm powder .. here we describe a redesigned protocol of the yeast estrogen screen developed by routledge and sumpter . the redesigned test comprises two steps . first , a large amount of yeast with estrogenic compounds is incubated for 24 hr . subsequently , a mixture of cycloheximide and the chromogenic substrate chlorophenol red - beta - d - galactopyranoside ( cprg ) is added . the cycloheximide stops protein synthesis and allows for an end - point measurement of beta - galactosidase activity generated during the first 24 hr . cprg is converted to chlorophenol red and reflects beta - galactosidase activity , which is indicative of the estrogenic activity . the modifications shorten the duration of the assay at least 1 day and avoid interference of the estrogenic cprg or chlorophenol red . the redesigned and the original protocol were used to study the estrogenic activity of bisphenol a , methoxychlor , p , p '- ddt , and isoflavones ( genistein , daidzein , and glycitein ). bisphenol a , methoxychlor , and genistein triggered higher levels of beta - galactosidase activity in the redesigned protocol . estrogenic activity of p , p '- ddt could only be demonstrated with the redesigned protocol . glycitein and daidzein failed to give a response with both protocols . we also studied deconjugation of beta - glycosidic isoflavones present in soygerm powder . treatment of the soygerm powder with beta - glycosidase released isoflavones . the estrogenic response of the samples was confirmed with the redesigned protocol and correlated with the amount of genistein present . the release of isoflavones under conditions prevailing in the intestines was studied . bacterial beta - glycosidase present in the large intestine released isoflavones , and moderate estrogenic activity could be demonstrated .	0
certain styrene oligomers have proliferative activity on mcf - 7 human breast tumor cells and binding affinity for human estrogen receptor .. to examine the estrogenic activities of styrene oligomers , we carried out cell proliferation assays with estrogen - sensitive mcf - 7 cells and competitive binding assays to human estrogen receptor [ alpha ] ( her [ alpha ]). the styrene oligomers tested were 1 , 3 - diphenyl propane ( sd - 1 ), 2 , 4 - diphenyl - 1 - butene ( sd - 2 ), cis - 1 , 2 - diphenyl cyclobutane ( sd - 3 ), trans - 1 , 2 - diphenyl cyclobutane ( sd - 4 ), 2 , 4 , 6 - triphenyl - 1 - hexene ( st - 1 ), 1a - phenyl - 4a -( 1 '- phenylethyl ) tetralin ( st - 2 ), 1a - phenyl - 4e -( 1 '- phenylethyl ) tetralin ( st - 3 ), 1e - phenyl - 4a -( 1 '- phenylethyl ) tetralin ( st - 4 ), 1e - phenyl - 4e -( 1 '- phenylethyl ) tetralin ( st - 5 ), 1e , 3e , 5a - triphenylcyclohexane ( st - 6 ), and 1e , 3e , 5e - triphenylcyclohexane ( st - 7 ). in the mcf - 7 cell proliferation assay , styrene trimers ( st - 1 , st - 3 , st - 4 , and st - 5 ) had the highest proliferative activities of the compounds tested . the relative potency of these chemicals was 0 . 0002 - 0 . 0015 %, which was comparable with that of bisphenol a ( 0 . 0001 - 0 . 0025 %), and their relative proliferative effect was 51 - 104 %. styrene dimers ( sd - 3 and sd - 4 ) also significantly increased the cell yields . however , sd - 1 , sd - 2 , st - 2 , st - 6 , and st - 7 had insignificant proliferative activities . the competitive binding assay revealed the binding affinity of some styrene oligomers for her [ alpha ]. the order of their binding potency for her [ alpha ] was as follows : st - 4 > st - 2 > st - 3 > st - 5 > st - 1 > sd - 3 > sd - 4 > sd - 2 > sd - 1 . st - 6 and st - 7 did not appear to bind to her [ alpha ]. the present studies indicate that styrene dimers sd - 3 and sd - 4 and styrene trimers st - 1 , st - 3 , st - 4 , and st - 5 have estrogenic activity on mcf - 7 cells and binding affinity for her [ alpha ]. these compounds might be endocrine disrupters .	0
application of a yeast estrogen screen in non - biomarker species varicorhinus barbatulus fish with two estrogen receptor subtypes to assess xenoestrogens .. xenoestrogens can interfere with normal estrogen signaling by competitively binding to the estrogen receptor ( er ) and activating transcription of target genes . in this study , we cloned the estrogen receptor alpha ( vberalpha ) and beta 2 ( vberbeta2 ) genes from liver of the indigenous taiwanese cyprinid fish varicorhinus barbatulus and tested the direct impact of several xenoestrogens on these ers . transcriptional activity of xenoestrogens was measured by the enzymatic activity of estrogen responsive element ( ere )- containing beta - galactosidase in a yeast reporter system . the xenoestrogens tested were phenol derivatives , ddt - related substances , phthalic acid esters , and polychlorinated biphenyls , with 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) as a subjective standard . the phenol derivatives [ 4 - nonylphenol ( 4 - np ), 4 - t - octylphenol ( 4 - t - op ) and bisphenol a ( bpa )] exhibited significant dose - dependent responses in both ligand potency and ligand efficiency . consistent with yeast assays using human or rainbow trout ers , we observed a general subtype preference in that vberalpha displayed higher relative potencies and efficiencies than vberbeta2 , although our assays induced a stronger response for xenoestrogens than did human or trout ers . whereas 4 - np and 4 - t - op have similar ec50 values relative to e2 for both er subtypes , the strong estrogenic response of bpa markedly differentiates vberalpha from vberbeta2 , suggesting possible species - specific bpa sensitivity . we report that the ameliorative yeast tool is readily applicable for indigenous wildlife studies of the bio - toxic influence of xenoestrogens with wildlife - specific estrogen receptors .	0
phytoglycoprotein ( 75 kda ) suppresses release of histamine and expression of il - 4 and ifn - gamma in bpa - treated rbl - 2h3 cells .. the current study investigated whether the phytoglycoprotein ( 75 kda ) isolated from cudrania tricuspidata bureau ( ctb glycoprotein ) has anti - allergic inflammatory potential . bisphenol a ( bpa ) is well known to promote development of allergy - related immune dysfunction . this experiment evaluated the release of histamine , increased intracellular ca ( 2 +) level , and the activities of protein kinase c alpha ( pkc alpha ), transcription factors nfkappab and cytokines ( il - 4 , and ifn - gamma ) in bpa - treated rbl - 2h3 cells . the results in this study showed that the phytoglycoprotein ( 75 kda ) inhibits the intracellular ca ( 2 +) level , translocation of pkc alpha from cytosol to membrane and the translocation of nf - kappab in cells . we also found that the phytoglycoprotein ( 75 kda ) inhibits the release of histamine , and the expressions of cytokines ( il - 4 and ifn - gamma ) in the presence of bpa in rbl - 2h3 cells . the results obtained from these experiments indicated that the phytoglycoprotein ( 75 kda ) inhibits release of histamine and expressions of il - 4 , and ifn - gamma via down regulations of ca ( 2 +)/ pkcalpha and nf - kappab on the stage of degranulation induced by bpa . from point of view , we speculated that the phytoglycoprotein ( 75 kda ) is one of natural compounds that can block allergic - inflammation caused by bpa .	0
combining passive samplers and biomonitors to evaluate endocrine disrupting compounds in a wastewater treatment plant by lc / ms / ms and bioassay analyses .. two types of integrative sampling approaches ( passive samplers and biomonitors ) were tested for their sampling characteristics of selected endocrine disrupting compounds ( edcs ). chemical analyses ( lc / ms / ms ) were used to determine the amounts of five edcs ( nonylphenol , bisphenol a , estrone , 17beta - estradiol and 17alpha - ethinylestradiol ) in polar organic chemical integrative samplers ( pocis ) and freshwater mussels ( unio pictorum ); both had been deployed in the influent and effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant ( wwtp ) in genoa , italy . estrogenicity of the pocis samples was assessed using the yeast estrogen screen ( yes ). estradiol equivalent values derived from the bioassay showed a positive correlation with estradiol equivalents calculated from chemical analyses data . as expected , the amount of estrogens and eeq values in the effluent were lower than those in the influent . passive sampling proved to be the preferred method for assessing the presence of these compounds since employing mussels had several disadvantages both in sampling efficiency and sample analyses .	0
masking severely tetracycline - stained teeth with ceramic laminate veneers .. when the primary restorative objective is the reinstatement of vital natural tooth color , dark tetracycline - stained teeth still represent the ultimate challenge for ceramic laminate veneers . masking severe stain with opaquing composite resins is a significant advancement ; however , the procedure requires additional chairtime , is technique sensitive ( to avoid excessive opacity ), and involves removal of additional tooth structure . the learning objective of this article is to describe and compare two different methods for masking tetracycline - stained teeth . the article illustrates the natural tooth color derived from ceramic laminate veneers when bonded to opaque composite resins in the maxillary arch , and compares it to a new ceramic veneer formulation in the mandibular arch , which masks the stain , eliminates the need for subopaquing with composite resins , and resembles the qualities of natural tooth color .	0

cognitive effects of endocrine - disrupting chemicals in animals .. a large number of chemical pollutants including phthalates , alkylphenolic compounds , polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins , organochlorine pesticides , bisphenol a , and metals including lead , mercury , and cadmium have the ability to disrupt endocrine function in animals . some of these same chemicals have been shown to alter cognitive function in animals and humans . because hormonally mediated events play a central role in central nervous system development and function , a number of researchers have speculated that the changes in cognitive function are mediated by the endocrine - like actions of these chemicals . in this paper we review the evidence that cognitive effects of chemicals classified as environmental endocrine disruptors are mediated by changes in hormonal function . we begin by briefly reviewing the role of gonadal steroids , thyroid hormones , and glucocorticoids in brain development and brain function . we then review the endocrine changes and cognitive effects that have been reported for selected endocrine - disrupting chemicals , discuss the evidence for causal relationships between endocrine disruption and cognitive effects , and suggest directions for future research .	0
in vitro comparison of peak polymerization temperatures of 5 provisional restoration resins .. background : the heat produced by provisional restoration materials may injure the dental pulp . this study measured and compared peak temperatures during polymerization of 5 materials used in the fabrication of provisional restorations . methods : the tested materials were 2 self - curing resins ( integrity and protemp ) and 3 dual - cure resins ( iso - temp , tcb dual cure and provipont dc ). a mould the size of a maxillary molar tooth was fabricated to contain 0 . 5 cc of resin . the temperature rise of the different materials was recorded every 10 seconds over a 10 - minute period . results : the rise in temperature of integrity ( peak temperature of 33 . 8 degrees c ) and protemp garant ( 35 . 6 degrees c ) was significantly higher than the rise in temperature of iso - temp ( 29 . 5 degrees c ), tcb dual cure ( 28 . 4 degrees c ) and provipont dc ( 29 . 5 degrees c ). conclusion : use of the dual - cure resins in provisional restorations may reduce the risk of pulp injury .	0
relationship between expression of sex steroid receptors and structure of the seminal vesicles after neonatal treatment of rats with potent or weak estrogens .. in this study we evaluated the effect of manipulating the estrogen and androgen environment of the neonatal male rat on subsequent immunoexpression of sex steroid receptors in the seminal vesicles ( svs ) at age 18 days . the aim was to establish to what extent such changes were associated with and predictive of changes in sv structure / composition . treatments were either diethylstilbestrol ( des ; 10 , 1 , or 0 . 1 microg / injection ), ethinyl estradiol ( ee ; 10 microg / injection ), tamoxifen ( 2 mg / kg / day ), flutamide ( 50 mg / kg ), a gonadotropin - releasing hormone antagonist ( gnrha ; 10 mg / kg ), genistein ( 4 mg / kg / day ), octylphenol ( 2 mg / injection ), or bisphenol a ( 0 . 5 mg / injection ). compared with controls , treatment with des ( 10 microg ) induced loss of epithelial and stromal androgen receptor ( ar ) immunoexpression coincident with induction of stromal progesterone receptor ( pr ) immunoexpression and upregulation of stromal immunoexpression of estrogen receptor - alpha ( eralpha ). these changes were associated with gross distortion ( increase ) of the normal stromal : epithelial tissue proportions in the svs . des ( 1 microg ) and ee induced similar but less pronounced changes , and des ( 0 . 1 microg ) had no noticeable effect . tamoxifen and flutamide induced pr and slightly upregulated eralpha immunoexpression but had only a minor or no effect on ar expression and the stromal : epithelial ratio , though flutamide retarded normal development of the svs . the latter was also evident in gnrha - treated males , but otherwise this treatment had no effect on ar and pr immunoexpression . none of the foregoing treatments had any detectable effect on the immunoexpression of erss in stromal or epithelial cells . the major treatment - induced changes in immunoexpression of ar , pr , and eralpha and lack of change in erss were confirmed by western blots of sv protein extracts . none of the three weak ( environmental ) estrogens tested caused any detectable change in sex steroid receptor immunoexpression or sv tissue composition . we conclude that treatment - induced loss of ar is a prerequisite for altered stromal : epithelial proportions in the svs and that such loss is always associated with induction of pr and upregulation of eralpha ; the latter two changes are insufficient on their own to bring about such a change . nevertheless , induction of pr expression was always associated with altered sv development and is a potentially useful marker because it is not normally expressed in male reproductive tissues .	0
the continued in vivo evaluation of the wear of restorative resins .. this study reports on the 3 - year results of a method designed to measure the in vivo wear rates of resin systems in denture teeth . adaptic and profile showed the most amounts of wear , followed by finesse , miradapt , and isopast . the least amounts of wear were seen with isosit and silar . the similarity to the magnitudes of wear reported in other studies suggests the appropriateness of using this technique .	0
bonding agent underneath sealant : shear bond strength to oil - contaminated .. this study evaluated in vitro the shear bond strength of a resin - based pit - and - fissure sealant ( fluroshield - f ) associated with either an ethanol - based ( adper single bond 2 - sb ) or an acetone - based ( prime & bond - pb ) adhesive system under conditions of oil contamination . mesial and distal enamel surfaces from 30 sound third molars were randomly assigned to 2 groups ( n = 30 ): i - no oil contamination ; ii - oil contamination . contamination ( 0 . 25 ml during 10 s ) was performed after 37 % phosphoric acid etching with an air / oil spray . the specimens were randomly assigned to subgroups , according to the bonding protocol adopted : subgroup a - f was applied to enamel without an intermediate bonding agent layer ; in subgroups b and c , sb and pb , respectively , were applied , light - cured , and then f was applied and light - cured . shear bond strength was tested at a crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / min in a universal testing machine . means (+/- sd ) in mpa were : ia - 11 . 28 (+/- 1 . 84 ); iia - 12 . 02 (+/- 1 . 15 ); ib - 9 . 73 (+/- 2 . 38 ); iib - 9 . 62 (+/- 2 . 29 ); ic - 28 . 30 (+/- 1 . 63 ); and iic - 25 . 50 (+/- 1 . 91 ). it may be concluded that the oil contamination affected negatively the sealant bonding to enamel and the acetone - based adhesive system ( pb ) layer applied underneath the sealant was able to prevent its deleterious effects to adhesion .	0
concentrations of bisphenol a and seven other phenols in pooled sera from 3 - 11 year old children : 2001 - 2002 national health and nutrition examination survey .. concerns exist regarding children ' s exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) and other phenols because of the higher sensitivity , compared to adults , of children ' s developing organs to endocrine disruptors . several studies reported the urinary concentrations of these phenols in children , but data on levels of these compounds in children ' s serum are limited . we present here the total ( free plus conjugated ) and free concentrations of bpa and seven other phenols in 24 pooled serum samples prepared from individual specimens collected from 936 children 3 - 11 years old who participated in the 2001 - 2002 national health and nutrition examination survey . we detected benzophenone - 3 , triclosan , 2 , 4 - dichlorophenol , 2 , 5 - dichlorophenol , and three parabens in at least 60 % of the pools suggesting children ' s exposure to these compounds or their precursors . conjugated phenols were the major species . however , although many previous studies have shown widespread detection of bpa in children ' s urine , we only detected total or free bpa in 3 and 2 pooled serum samples , respectively , at concentrations of 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 μg / l . the nonpersistent nature of bpa and the phenols examined and the likely episodic nature of the exposures to these compounds ( or their precursors ) suggest that for general population biomonitoring of these nonpersistent phenols , urine , not serum or plasma , is the preferred matrix .	0
sealing of occlusal hidden caries lesions : an alternative for curative treatment ?. the bacterial composition of the dentine of thirty molars with sealed occlusal surfaces ( delton tinted ) was examined . undiagnosed hidden caries was present at the time of treatment . although clinically assessed as good ( age 3 . 4 years , s . d . 2 . 1 ), 47 percent of the sealants had a marginal defect , when assessed with sem . the dentine of the treated teeth was of a soft consistency . the median of the number of microorganisms was 400 ( range 0 - 3 . 10 ( 5 )) cfu per sample . mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were found in 53 percent of the samples . no relationship was found between the number of microorganisms and the marginal adaptation of the sealant , when examined under sem ; neither was a relationship found between the age of the sealant and the number of microorganisms ( kendall ' s tau - c = 0 . 17 , n . s . and - 0 . 01 , n . s ., respectively ). at present , there are insufficient grounds for treating nonvisible lesions ( with a radiolucency on the bitewing ) with a resin sealant .	0
quantitative analysis of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides , pyrethroid transformation products , polybrominated diphenyl ethers and bisphenol a in residential surface wipe samples .. surface wipe sampling is a frequently used technique for measuring persistent pollutants in residential environments . one characteristic of this form of sampling is the need to extract the entire wipe sample to achieve adequate sensitivity and to ensure representativeness . most surface wipe methods require collection of multiple samples for related chemicals or chemical classes having similar physiochemical properties . in an effort to analyze a broad suite of pollutants collected from a single surface wipe sample , we developed a new method for the analysis of selected organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides , pyrethroid transformation products ( tps ), bisphenol a ( bpa ) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( pbdes ). this is the first time this suite of compounds has been analyzed from a single indoor wipe sample because of the issues uniquely related to these sample types , namely high levels of interfering compounds such as phthalate esters and other residues found in the indoor environment . this new method uses extraction via sonication followed by solvent exchange into hexane , clean - up and liquid / liquid extraction . the extract portion containing insecticides and pbdes is further purified using solid phase extraction prior to concentration and analysis . the portion containing bpa and tps is solvent exchanged into ethyl acetate before concentration and derivatization with 99 : 1 trimethylsilyl 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoro - n -( trimethylsilyl ) acetimidate : chlorotrimethylsilane . wipe extract sub - classes were then analyzed by gc / ms in electron impact mode for insecticides , bpa and tps while negative chemical ionization mode was employed for pbdes . method detection limits were < 16 . 4 pg / cm ( 2 ) for all compounds with most being < 5 pg / cm² . over 400 samples , including qa / qc samples , were analyzed with mean surrogate recoveries ranging from 76 to 95 %. the most frequently detected chemicals from our suite were chlorpyrifos , permethrin , bisphenol a , bde - 47 , bde - 99 and bde - 100 . permethrin ( 107 pg / cm² on floors and 18 pg / cm² on windows ) and bisphenol a ( 110 pg / cm² on floors and 6 . 8 pg / cm² on windows ) had the highest concentrations measured in the wipe samples . results from the method evaluation and routine sample analysis are presented .	0
load fatigue of teeth restored by a dentin bonding agent and a posterior composite resin .. a three - surface mod preparation measuring one third of the isthmus cavity distance at the isthmus was prepared for five extracted , intact human maxillary premolar teeth . the teeth were restored with a posterior resin and a dentin bonding agent . each tooth was tested under a cyclically varying load in a fatigue machine made at the university of washington . the cyclic load rate was 75 cycles per minute . a strain gauge was applied to the buccal surface of each tooth . under the load applied at an angle of 60 degrees to the long axis of the tooth , reinforcement of the tooth was established by the reduced deflection of the buccal surface of the restored tooth as compared with the unrestored tooth . the loss of this reinforcement due to the application of the cyclically varying load established the end point of the fatigue testing . four different load values of 13 , 16 , 19 , and 22 lb loads were applied separately to each tooth . the results of this testing were classic wherein the smallest load required the greatest number of load cycles before loss of adhesion was registered by the strain gauge . failure always occurred within the adhesive joint .	0
prediction of metabolic clearance of bisphenol a ( 4 , 4 '- dihydroxy - 2 , 2 - diphenylpropane ) using cryopreserved human hepatocytes .. this study investigated the kinetics of glucuronidation of bisphenol a ( bpa ; 4 , 4 '- dihydroxy - 2 , 2 - diphenylpropane ) in cryopreserved human hepatocytes ( hcs ). incubation conditions were developed using sprague - dawley rat hcs . for determination of the kinetic constants of bpa glucuronidation rates with human hcs , viable hcs ( 0 . 125 x 10 ( 6 )) were incubated with [( 14 ) c ] bpa ( 1 . 3 - 52 microm ) for 10 min . the glucuronidation reaction demonstrated michaelis - menten kinetics and yielded a mean k ( m ) for males and females of 9 +/- 3 and 8 +/- 2 microm , respectively . the v ( max ) values of these reactions were 438 +/- 129 pmol / min / 10 ( 6 ) for male hcs and 480 +/- 208 pmol / min / 10 ( 6 ) for female hcs . the scaled intrinsic clearance ( cl ( int )) for male human hcs was 149 +/- 67 ml / min / kg ( range 53 - 246 ) and for female hcs was 165 +/- 89 ml / min / kg ( range 73 - 336 ). overall , there are no apparent gender differences in the glucuronidation of bpa . these cl ( int ) values were then extrapolated to estimate total hepatic metabolic clearance ( cl ( met )) using a nonrestrictive well stirred model . the estimated cl ( met ) value for both male and female hcs was 6 ml / min / kg , which represents 30 % of hepatic blood flow . thus , in vivo clearance seems to depend highly on plasma protein binding . these in vitro results correlate well with in vivo studies in humans , which report extensive glucuronidation of bpa .	0
environmental contaminants : is male reproductive health at risk ?. contaminants such as cadmium , bisphenol a and lead pollute our environment and affect male reproductive function . there is evidence that toxicant exposure adversely affects fertility . cadmium and bisphenol a exert their effects in the testis by perturbing blood - testis barrier function , which in turn affects germ cell adhesion in the seminiferous epithelium because of a disruption of the functional axis between these sites . in essence , cadmium mediates its adverse effects at the blood - testis barrier by disrupting cell adhesion protein complexes , illustrating that toxicants can dismantle cell junctions in the testis . herein , we will discuss how environmental toxicants may affect reproductive function . we will also examine how these adverse effects on fertility may be mediated in part by adipose tissue and bone . lastly , we will briefly discuss how toxicant - induced damage may be effectively managed so that fertility can be maintained . it is hoped that this information will offer a new paradigm for future studies .	0
construction of triple - transfected cells [ organic anion - transporting polypeptide ( oatp ) 1b1 / multidrug resistance - associated protein ( mrp ) 2 / mrp3 and oatp1b1 / mrp2 / mrp4 ] for analysis of the sinusoidal function of mrp3 and mrp4 .. multidrug resistance - associated protein ( mrp ) 3 / abcc3 and mrp4 / abcc4 are atp - binding cassette ( abc ) transporters expressed in the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes . the purpose of the present study was to establish organic anion - transporting polypeptide ( oatp ) 1b1 / mrp2 / mrp3 and oatp1b1 / mrp2 / mrp4 triple transfectants as in vitro model of the hepatobiliary transport of anionic drugs . to find in vivo relevant mrp3 probes , wild - type and mrp3 (-/-) mice were given gemfibrozil , 6 - hydroxy - 5 , 7 - dimethyl - 2 - methylamino - 4 -( 3 - pyridymethyl ) benzothiazole ( e3040 ), troglitazone , bisphenol a , and 4 - methylumbelliferone orally . plasma concentrations of the glucuronide conjugates were significantly lower in mrp3 (-/-) mice than in wild - type mice . the systemic exposure of gemfibrozil , e3040 , and troglitazone were similar in wild - type and mrp3 (-/-) mice . 4 - methylumbelliferone and bisphenol a were undetectable in the plasma . in mrp3 - expressing membrane vesicles , atp - dependent uptakes of the glucuronide conjugates of estradiol , gemfibrozil , e3040 , and troglitazone were markedly greater than those in controls , whereas mrp4 - expressing membrane vesicles exhibited significant atp - dependent uptake of gemfibrozil glucuronide and estradiol glucuronide . mrp3 or mrp4 was expressed in the oatp1b1 / mrp2 double transfectants using adenovirus . the expression levels of oatp1b1 and mrp2 proteins were maintained both in the oatp1b1 / mrp2 / mrp3 and oatp1b1 / mrp2 / mrp4 triple transfectants , whereas mrp3 and mrp4 were localized in the basal membrane . significant reductions in the basal - to - apical flux of the glucuronide conjugates of estradiol , gemfibrozil , e3040 , and troglitazone were observed in the oatp1b1 / mrp2 / mrp3 triple transfectants compared with those in the double transfectants , whereas significant reduction was observed only for gemfibrozil glucuronide and estradiol glucuronide in the oatp1b1 / mrp2 / mrp4 triple transfectants . these results suggest that mrp3 - or mrp4 - triple transfectants provide a simple and useful in vitro system for evaluating their importance in the hepatobiliary transport of drugs .	0
effects of bisphenol a on energy balance and accumulation in brown adipose tissue in rats .. some environmental contaminants have the potential to affect humans or animals by mimicking the effects of hormones . bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a weak estrogen agonist when tested using in vitro or in vivo bioassays . in addition to the well documented effects of estrogens on reproductive functions , ovarian hormones also have salient effects on mammalian energy balance and feeding behavior . in this study , we investigated the effects of bpa on body weight and food intake of ovariectomized adult female rats . treatment with doses of 4 or 5 mg / day for 15 days resulted in a significant reduction of body weight gain with no reduction in food intake . a dose of 1 mg / day did not affect feeding or weight gain . bpa was detected in the blood , brain and adipose tissues of the bpa - treated animals but not in the vehicle control group . there was a preferential concentration of bpa in brown adipose tissue . these results indicate that bpa can affect energy balance and that brown adipose tissue may be a primary tissue into which bpa accumulates in mammals .	1
fracture toughness of dental restorative materials .. the ability of a restorative material to withstand fracture is of crucial importance especially in stress - bearing area . therefore , the study aims to analyse the fracture toughness of a large number of dental restorative materials categories . the fracture toughness ( k ( ic )) of 69 restorative materials belonging to ten materials categories - micro - hybrid , nanofilled , microfilled , packable , ormocer - based , and flowable resin - based composites ( rbc ), compomers and flowable compomers , as well as glass ionomer cements ( gic ) and resin - modified gic was measured by means of the single - edge notched - beam method after storing the samples ( n = 8 ) for 24 h in distilled water . data were analyzed with the one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by the tukey ' s test and partial eta - squared statistics ( p < 0 . 05 ). large variations between the tested materials within a material category were found . the lowest fracture toughness was reached in the gic group , followed by the microfilled rbcs , resin - modified gic , and flowable compomers , which do not differ significantly among each other as a material group . the ormocer - based , packable , and micro - hybrid rbcs performed statistically similar , reaching the highest fracture toughness values . between the two categories of flowables - composites and compomers - no differences were measured . the correlation between k ( ic ) and filler volume ( 0 . 34 ) and respective filler weight ( 0 . 40 ) was low . k ( ic ) increased with the volume fraction of fillers until a critical value of 57 %, following with a plateau , with constant values until ca . 65 % volume fraction . above this value , k ( ic ) decreased slightly . due to the very large variability of the fracture toughness within a material type , the selection of a suitable restorative material should have not been done with respect to a specific material category , especially in stress - bearing areas , but by considering the individual measured material properties .	0
surface treatment studies aimed at streamlining fissure sealant application .. three laboratory studies were carried out with the aim of improving or streamlining enamel surface treatment procedures in fissure sealing . in study 1 , the effect of reducing acid etch time from 60 s to 10 s was assessed by sem and tensile bond strength measurements . reduction in etch time produced a finer etch pattern , gave a reduced but still high , bond - strength , albeit with slightly poorer long - term adhesion . study 2 showed that a conventional acid etch treatment could completely remove acquired pellicle , without prior prophylaxis . sem studies and bond - strength measurements corroborated this view . in study 3 , compressed air and chemical drying agents were compared for drying speed and efficiency . compressed air gave more rapid , thorough drying , and greater resultant bond strengths .	0

chlorhexidine diminishes the loss of bond strength over time under simulated pulpal pressure and thermo - mechanical stressing .. objectives : the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of chlorhexidine ( chx ) digluconate at 0 . 2 % and 2 % on dentin bonding durability of etch - and - rinse and self - etch adhesive systems . methods : in this study were used 24 extracted non - carious human third - molars . the occlusal surfaces of the molar crowns were removed with a low - speed diamond saw to expose flat dentin surfaces . the tested materials were single - bond ( sb ) ( two - step etch - and - rinse adhesive ) and clearfil tri s bond ( ctsb ) ( all - in - one self - etch adhesive ) used in association or not with chx at 0 . 2 % and 2 %. the bonding systems were applied according to manufacturer ' s instructions and followed by composite application ( z250 ). for each condition , half of the specimens was immediately submitted to microtensile test and half of them was submitted to long - term storage of 6 months under simulated pulpal pressure and thermo - mechanical stressing before testing . the data were analyzed using two - way anova and tukey post hoc test ( alpha = 0 . 05 ). failure patterns of the specimens were observed using scanning electron microscopy . results : the falling % in bond strength over the 6 - month period was : sb control - 43 . 64 %; sb / 0 . 2 % chx - 23 . 79 %; sb / 2 % chx - 26 . 42 %; ctsb control - 40 . 94 %; ctsb / 0 . 2 % chx - 37 . 07 %; ctsb / 2 % chx - 22 . 14 %. the fracture modes were predominantly adhesive , mainly in the specimens of terminal groups . conclusions : cxh digluconate at 2 % was able to diminish loss of microtensile bond strength over time associated to both etch - and - rinse and self - etch adhesives . lower concentration of chx ( 0 . 2 %) was not able to diminish the loss of bond strength over time when associated to the self - etch adhesive ctsb .	0
ctb glycoprotein ( 75kda ) inhibits ige releasing , tnf - α and il - 6 expressed by bisphenol a in vivo and in vitro .. cudrania tricuspidata bureau ( ctb ) has been used to treat allergies and inflammatory disease as folk medicine in korea . the objective of this study is to determine whether a glycoprotein isolated from ctb ( 75 kda ) has a preventive potential of allergic inflammation caused by bisphenol a ( bpa ) in balb / c mice and rbl - 2h3 cells . production of immunoglobulin ( ig ) e and releasing of β - hexosaminidase and histamine at treatment of ctb glycoprotein ( 5 - 10mg / kg , bw ) were evaluated in mice serum . activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( erk ) and p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ), activator protein ( ap )- 1 , expressions of pro - inflammatory cytokines , nitric oxide ( no ) production and cyclooxygenase ( cox )- 2 were assessed in rbl - 2h3 cells . in the results , ctb glycoprotein ( 10mg / kg , bw ) inhibited the production of ige and releasing of β - hexosaminidase and histamine . also , the ctb glycoprotein ( 100 μg / ml ) blocked phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 and p38 mapk , and the activation of ap - 1 , while it inhibited the no production , activities of cox - 2 , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf )- α , and interleukin ( il )- 6 , but not il - 1β . taken together , the results of this study indicated that the ctb glycoprotein modulates the expression of allergic inflammation - related factors via the suppression of mapk / ap - 1 activation .	0
pollution gets personal ! a first population - based human biomonitoring study in austria .. humans are exposed to a broad variety of man - made chemicals . human biomonitoring ( hbm ) data reveal the individual body burden irrespective of sources and routes of uptake . a first population - based study was started in austria in 2008 and was finished at the end of may 2011 . this cross sectional study aims at documenting the extent , the distribution and the determinants of human exposure to industrial chemicals as well as proving the feasibility of a representative hbm study . overall , 150 volunteers ( 50 families ) were selected by stratified random sampling . exposure to phthalates , trisphosphates , polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( pbde ), bisphenol a ( along with nonyl - and octyl phenol ) and methyl mercury was assessed . sixteen of 18 pbde determined were detected above the limit of quantification ( loq ) in blood samples with # 153 and # 197 the most abundant species . bisphenol a in urine was measured in a subsample of 25 with only 4 samples found above the loq . in 3 of 100 urine samples at least one of 8 trisphosphate compounds assessed was above the loq . these first analytical results of the human biomonitoring data show that the body burden of the austrian population with respect to the assessed compounds is comparable to or even lower than in other european countries . overall , the study revealed that in order to develop a feasible protocol for representative human biomonitoring studies procedures have to be optimized to allow for non - invasive sampling of body tissues in accordance with the main metabolic pathways . procedures of participants ' recruitment were , however , labor intensive and have to be improved .	0
in vitro comparison of the retention capacity of new aesthetic brackets .. tensile bond strength and bond failure location were evaluated in vitro for two types of aesthetic brackets ( non - silanated ceramic , polycarbonate ) and one stainless steel bracket , using bovine teeth as the substrate and diacrylate resin as the adhesive . the results show that metallic bracket had the highest bond strength ( 13 . 21 n ) followed by the new plastic bracket ( 12 . 01 n ), which does not require the use of a primer . the non - silanated ceramic bracket produced the lowest bond strength ( 8 . 88 n ). bond failures occurred mainly between bracket and cement , although a small percentage occurred between the enamel - cement interface with the metal and plastic brackets and within the cement for the plastic bracket . with the ceramic bracket all the failures occurred at the bracket - cement interface . this suggests that the problems of enamel lesions produced by this type of bracket may have been eliminated . the results also show that the enamel / adhesive bond is stronger than the adhesive / bracket bond in this in vitro study .	0
microtensile bond strengths to enamel of self - etching and one bottle adhesive systems .. unlabelled : this study compared the enamel bond strengths of self - etching and one bottle adhesives , and evaluated microscopically their debonding modes . evaluated systems were : self - etch -- prompt l - pop ( lp ); one bottle , total etch -- single bond ( sb ), prime & bond nt ( pb ); compomer -- hytac aplitip ( ha ), f2000 ( f2 ); resin composite - reference 21 aplitip ( r2 ), herculite xrv ( xrv ), esthet . x ( ex ); in the following combinations : lp / ha ; lp / r2 ; sb / f2 ; sb / xrv ; pb / ex . flat surfaces of enamel were ground on caries free extracted third molars . an adhesive resin was applied to this surface and a restorative material built on it . the teeth were sectioned longitudinally into 1 mm thick specimens and trimmed to a 1 mm2 area at the enamel / adhesive interface . for each material combination , 10 specimens were tested . microtensile bond strengths were determined at 0 . 5 mm min (- 1 ). fractured specimens were examined using confocal and scanning electron microscopy to determine failure modes . bond strength data was analysed using kaplan - meier survival analysis , a log - rank test and a bonferroni multiple comparison . failure mode data was analysed with a chi2 test . the interface of additional fluorescent - labelled specimens was examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy . the bond strength data showed significant differences : lp / r2 > lp / ha , sb / f2 and pb / ex ; sb / f2 < lp / ha , sb / xrv and pb / ex . both compomers principally exhibited cohesive failure . resin composite materials showed more complex failure modes . fluorescence images demonstrated interfacial characteristics consistent with the failure modes observed . significance : bond strength was not influenced by the use of self - etch or one bottle adhesives .	0

effect of x - ray radiation dose on the bond strength of different adhesive systems to dentin .. purpose : to investigate the influence of different x - ray radiation doses on the bond strength of adhesive restorations to dentin using different bonding strategies . materials and methods : flat dentin surfaces on human molars were obtained and cylinder - shaped specimens for the microshear bond test were built up with a composite ( z250 , 3m espe ), using three adhesive systems : a two - step etch - and - rinse ( single bond 2 -- sb2 , 3m espe ), a two - step self - etching ( clearfil se bond -- cse , kuraray ), or a single - step self - etching ( adper prompt -- adp , 3m espe ). the specimens were assigned to 4 groups ( n = 10 ), according to the x - ray dose : 0 ( control ), 5 , 35 , or 70 gy . radiation was directed to the surface of the resin cylinders . microshear testing was conducted after 24 h , and the failure modes classified under magnification ( 200x ). data were submitted to two - way anova and holm - sidak ' s test ( p < or = 0 . 05 ). a nonlinear regression analysis was carried out with bond strength as dependent variable . results : bond strength results were dose and material dependent . sb2 : control > 5 = 35 > 70 ; cse : control = 5 > 35 = 70 ; adp : control = 5 = 35 = 70 . generally , sb2 > cse > adp . the nonlinear regression plots showed that in general , an increase in radiation dose may predict a decrease in bond strength ( r2 > or = 0 . 905 ). failure modes were dependent on the bonding system , generally with no significant influence of radiation . conclusion : x - ray radiation might present a dose - dependent detrimental effect on the bond strength of resin composite restorations to dentin .	0
influence of finishing time on marginal sealing ability of new generation composite bonding systems .. although variation in finishing techniques has been shown to affect microleakage , little research has been published on the influence of finishing time on the marginal sealing ability of new generation composite bonding systems . the objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of finishing time on the enamel and dentine marginal sealing ability of four new generation composite systems . two class v preparations , which were solely in enamel or dentine , were made on the buccal surfaces of 96 freshly extracted molar teeth . the teeth were randomly divided into four groups of 24 and restored with composite resin ( silux plus ) utilizing the following bonding systems : scotchbond multi - purpose , fuji bond lc , prime & bond 2 . 0 and bisco one - step . half of the restorations in each group were finished immediately after light polymerization and stored for 1 week . for the remaining restorations , finishing was delayed for 1 week . the storage medium was isotonic saline at 37 degrees c throughout the experiment . all restorations were then thermocycled , subjected to dye penetration testing , sectioned and scored . the results suggest that the finishing of composite restorations , bonded with the bonding systems evaluated , should be carried out immediately after light polymerization . delayed finishing does not improve but instead can be detrimental to the marginal seal of the restorations . the effects of delayed finishing are , however , both bonding system and tissue specific .	0
bond strength of composite core build - up materials to fiber - reinforced posts : a microtensile comparison between conventional and wet - ethanol bonding systems .. purpose : to evaluate the interfacial microtensile bond strength between a fiber - reinforced post ( rely x post ) and a core material ( multicore flow ) after placing different bonding agents . materials and methods : after post surface treatment , 50 posts were divided into 5 groups . group 1 : adper prompt - l - pop ; group 2 : singlebond2 ; group 3 : scotchbond multipurpose plus ; group 4 : experimental bonding system ( wet ethanol bonding technique ); group 5 : control group . after core reconstruction , the samples were tested with the microtensile test . fracture type examination and sem observation followed . data were statistically analyzed with kruskall - wallis non - parametric anova . results : microtensile testing revealed significant differences ( p < 0 . 001 ). there were no differences between groups 1 to 4 , but there was a statistically significant difference between groups 1 to 4 and the control . fracture type observations revealed more adhesive failures than cohesive or mixed ones . conclusion : the experimental bonding technique did not improve bond strength compared to the different adhesive systems tested . however , placing a bonding agent between the post and the core seems to significantly increase microtensile bond strength .	0
sulfation of bisphenol a abolished its estrogenicity based on proliferation and gene expression in human breast cancer mcf - 7 cells .. bisphenol a , an endocrine - disrupting chemical , is widely used in many consumer products . we previously showed the sulfoconjugation of bisphenol a catalyzed by a human thermostable phenol sulfotransferase , st1a3 . the estrogenic potency of bisphenol a sulfate was compared with that of bisphenol a by an e - screen assay using human breast cancer mcf - 7 cells . an increase in the expression level of an estrogen - responsive ps2 gene was also examined using mcf - 7 cells after exposure to bisphenol a and its sulfate for their estrogenicity . bisphenol a sulfate did not exhibit estrogenic effects at 0 . 1 microm ( e - screen assay ) and 1 mm ( ps2 gene expression ) compared with bisphenol a , which exhibited the effects at 3 nm ( e - screen assay ) and 1 microm ( ps2 gene expression ), respectively . we have therefore evaluated major roles of cytosolic phenol sulfotransferase in the human liver . bisphenol a sulfation in human liver cytosols was inhibited by more than 90 % by p - nitrophenol and quercetin , a typical substrate and specific inhibitor of phenol sulfotransferase , respectively . these results indicated that the estrogenicity of bisphenol a was abolished through its sulfation catalyzed by a human hepatic thermostable phenol sulfotransferase .	0

influence of airborne - particle abrasion on mechanical properties and bond strength of carbon / epoxy and glass / bis - gma fiber - reinforced resin posts .. statement of problem : controversy exists concerning the use of fiber - reinforced posts to improve bond strength to resin cement because some precementation treatments can compromise the mechanical properties of the posts . purpose : the purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of airborne - particle abrasion on the mechanical properties and microtensile bond strength ( mtbs ) of carbon / epoxy and glass / bis - gma fiber - reinforced resin posts . material and methods : flexural strength ( delta ( f )), flexural modulus ( e ( f )), and stiffness ( s ) were assessed using a 3 - point bending test for glass fiber - reinforced and carbon fiber - reinforced resin posts submitted to airborne - particle abrasion ( ab ) with 50 - microm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ), and for posts without any surface treatment ( controls ) ( n = 10 ). forty glass fiber ( gf ) and 40 carbon fiber ( cf ) posts were submitted to 1 of 4 surface treatments ( n = 10 ) prior to mtbs testing : silane ( s ); silane and adhesive ( sa ); airborne - particle abrasion with 50 - microm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) and silane ( abs ); airborne - particle abrasion , silane , and adhesive ( absa ). two composite resin restorations ( filtek z250 ) with rounded depressions in the lateral face were bilaterally fixed to the post with resin cement ( relyx arc ). next , the specimen was sectioned with a precision saw running perpendicular to the bonded surface to obtain 10 bonded beam specimens with a cross - sectional area of 1 mm ( 2 ). each beam specimen was tested in a mechanical testing machine ( emic 2 , 000 dl ), under stress , at a crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / min until failure . data were analyzed by 2 - way anova followed by tukey hsd test ( alpha =. 05 ). failure patterns of tested specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ). results : the 3 - point bending test demonstrated significant differences among groups only for the post type factor for flexural strength , flexural modulus , and stiffness . the carbon fiber posts exhibited significantly higher mean flexural strength ( p =. 001 ), flexural modulus ( p =. 003 ), and stiffness ( p =. 001 ) values when compared with glass fiber posts , irrespective of surface treatment . an alteration in the superficial structure of the posts could be observed by sem after airborne - particle abrasion . mtbs testing showed no significant effect for the surface treatment type ; however , significant effects for post system factor and for interaction between the 2 factors were observed . for the carbon fiber post , the absa surface treatment resulted in values significantly lower than the s surface treatment . sem analysis of mtbs - tested specimens demonstrated adhesive and cohesive failures . conclusions : airborne - particle abrasion did not influence the mechanical properties of the post ; however , it produced undesirable surface changes , which could reduce the bond strength to resin cement . for the surface treatments studied , if silane is applied , the adhesive system and airborne - particle abrasion are not necessary .	0
mutagenic potential of bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) and its hydrolysis - derived products in the ames salmonella assay .. the mutagenicity of bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ), its first and second hydrolysis products ( the diol epoxide and bis - diol of badge , respectively ) and the bis - chlorohydrin of badge were investigated using the ames salmonella assay with strains ta98 , ta100 , ta1535 and ta1537 . the assays were performed in the absence and presence of various concentrations of rat liver s9 fraction . the results obtained confirm the mutagenic power of badge in strains ta100 and ta1535 and show a positive response to the diol epoxide of badge in these strains , although the latter compound was approximately 10 times less potent than the former . a lack of mutagenic activity of the bis - diol of badge and the chlorohydrin under study is also shown . these findings suggest that badge and , to a much lesser extent , the diol epoxide of badge may constitute a genotoxic hazard , but not the bis - diol or bis - chlorohydrin of badge .	0
effect of solvent content on resin hybridization in wet dentin bonding .. with wet bonding techniques , the channels between the demineralized dentin collagen fibrils are filled with debris , solvent , and water . commercial adhesives include solvents such as ethanol or acetone to facilitate resin - infiltration into this wet substrate . under in vivo conditions , the solvent may be diluted because of repeated exposure of the material to the atmosphere , or concentrated because of separation of the bonding liquids into layers within the bottle . the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different concentrations of ethanol ( 10 - 50 %) on infiltration of the adhesive resin and collagen fibril encapsulation in the adhesive / dentin interface using light microscopy , micro - raman spectroscopy , and scanning electron microscopy . the results indicated that under wet bonding conditions the hybridization process was highly sensitive to the initial solvent concentration in the adhesive system . the staining and scanning electron microscopy results showed that the quality of the interfacial hybrid layer was poor at the lower ( 10 %) or higher ( 50 %) ethanol content . micro - raman analysis indicated that there was a distinct difference in the degree of adhesive penetration among adhesives containing different concentrations of ethanol . adhesives containing 10 or 50 % ethanol did not realize effective penetration ; the penetration of the adhesive monomers increased dramatically when the initial ethanol content was 30 %. the amount of solvents are essential for achieving effective bonding to dentin .	0

"""effect of whitening agents on dentin bonding .. background : several studies have shown a reduction in enamel bond strengths when the bonding procedure is carried out immediately after vital bleaching with peroxides . this reduction in bond strengths has become a concern in cosmetic dentistry with the introduction of new """" in - office """" and """" waiting - room """" bleaching techniques . the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of three bleaching regimens : 35 % hydrogen peroxide ( hp ), 35 % carbamide peroxide ( cp ), and 10 % cp , on dentin bond strengths . materials and methods : one hundred and twenty fresh bovine incisors were used in this study . the labial surface of each tooth was ground flat to expose dentin and was subsequently polished with 600 - grit wet silicon carbide paper . the remaining dentin thickness was monitored and kept at an average of 2 mm . the teeth were randomly assigned to four bleaching regimens ( n = 30 ): ( a ) control , no bleaching treatment ; ( b ) 35 % hp for 30 minutes ; ( c ) 35 % cp for 30 minutes ; and ( d ) 10 % cp for 6 hours . for each group , half of the specimens ( n = 15 ) were bonded with single bond / z100 immediately after the bleaching treatment , whereas the other half was bonded after the specimens were stored for 1 week in artificial saliva at 37 degrees c . the specimens were fractured in shear using an instron machine . results : for the groups bonded immediately after bleaching , one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by the duncan ' s post hoc test revealed a statistically significant reduction in bond strengths in a range from 71 % to 76 %. for the groups bonded at 1 week , one - way anova showed that group b ( 35 % hp for 30 min ) resulted in the highest bond strengths , whereas 10 % cp resulted in the lowest bond strengths . student ' s t - test showed that delayed bonding resulted in a significant increase in bond strengths for groups b ( 35 % hp ) and c ( 35 % cp ); whereas the group bleached with 10 % cp ( group d ) remained in the same range obtained for immediate bonding . storage in artificial saliva also affected the control group , reducing its bond strengths to 53 % of the original ."""	0
a study of the physical and chemical properties of four resin composite luting cements .. purpose : this study evaluated the surface microhardness and flexural and compressive strengths of five luting cements and compared the degree of conversion of dual and autopolymerized forms of four resin - based luting cements . materials and methods : four resin composite luting cements - panavia f , variolink 2 , relyx unicem applicap , and relyx arc - and a polycarboxylate cement ( durelon , control group ) were used in three - point bending , compression , and vickers hardness tests following water storage for 1 week . resin composite cements were additionally investigated with both dual and autopolymerization techniques under fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy . differences were analyzed using one - way anova . results : the highest flexural strengths were obtained with variolink 2 ( 90 mpa , sd 22 ), whereas the lowest were observed with durelon ( 28 mpa , sd 4 ). relyx unicem showed the highest hardness values ( 44 hv , sd 5 ), whereas variolink 2 gave the lowest ( 32 hv , sd 6 ). the highest compressive strengths were obtained with relyx unicem ( 145 mpa , sd 32 ), whereas the lowest were observed with durelon ( 41 mpa , sd 17 ). for both dual and autopolymerized groups , relyx arc showed the highest degrees of conversion ( 81 % and 61 %, respectively ) and relyx unicem had the lowest ( 56 % and 26 %, respectively ). conclusion : resin composite luting cements of similar chemical characterizations differed in their physical properties , and polymerization method influenced their degree of conversion .	0
adhesive strength between fiber - reinforced composites and veneering composites and fracture load of combinations of these materials .. purpose : this study examined the influence of the adhesive strength between fiber - reinforced composites ( frc ) and veneering composites on the fracture load of combinations of these materials . materials and methods : six materials were used . an experimental material called br - 100 , vectris , and fibrekor were the types of frc . estenia , targis , and sculpture were used as veneering composites . with the estenia / br - 100 combination , the surface of the frc was subjected to three different conditions before veneering . ten specimens of each combination were fabricated and divided into two groups : one group was stored in 37 degrees c distilled water for 24 hours , and the other was thermocycled ( 4 degrees c / 60 degrees c , 10 , 000 cycles ). adhesive strength between frcs and veneering composites was determined using the compressive shear strength test . in addition , fracture loads of laminate specimens were determined . results : good adhesive strength was obtained by leaving an unpolymerized layer on the surface of the frc or by performing silane and bonding treatment . in the estenia / br - 100 combination , when the adhesive strength was low , the fracture load of the laminate specimens was also low . however , the difference in fracture load was not as large as that seen in adhesive strength . the fracture load of each laminate specimen was significantly lower after thermocycling . conclusion : the adhesive strength between the frcs and veneering composite had an effect on the fracture load of the combination .	0
potentiation of the reductase activity of protein disulphide isomerase ( pdi ) by 19 - nortestosterone , bacitracin , fluoxetine , and ammonium sulphate .. protein disulphide isomerase ( pdi ) in the endoplasmic reticulum catalyzes the rearrangement of disulphide bridges during folding of secreted proteins . it binds various molecules that inhibit its activity . but here , we looked for molecules that would potentiate its activity . pdi reductase activity was measured in vitro using di - eosin - oxidized glutathione as substrate . its classical inhibitor bacitracin was found to exert a biphasic effect : stimulatory at low concentrations (∼ 10 (- 6 ) m ) and inhibitory only at higher concentrations (∼ 10 (- 4 )- 10 (- 3 ) m ). the weak oestrogenic molecule bisphenol a was found to exert a weak inhibitory effect on pdi reductase activity relative to the strong oestrogens , ethynylestradiol , and diethylstilbestrol . like 19 - nortestosterone , fluoxetine was found to exert a potentiating effect on pdi reductase activity and their potentiating effects could be reversed by increasing concentrations of oestrogens . in conclusion , this paper provides the first identification of potentiators of pdi activity that are potential pharmaceuticals against pathologies affecting protein folding such as alzheimer ' s disease .	0
sensitizing capacity and cross - reaction pattern of the isomers of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol f in the guinea pig .. in this study , the sensitizing capacities of the 3 main low - molecular - weight isomers of epoxy resins based on diglycidyl ether of biphenol f ( dgebf ) were investigated in a guinea pig maximization test ( gpmt ). the isomers are p , p '- dgebf , o , p '- dgebf , and o , o '- dgebf . the sensitization capacities were compared to diglycidyl ether of bisphenol a ( dgeba ), which is the main constituent in the most common epoxy resin . the cross - reaction pattern between all 4 compounds was also investigated . it was found that all 3 dgebf isomers were potent sensitizers . it was also found that p , p '- dgebf , o , p '- dgebf , and dgeba cross - reacted with one another , and that animals induced with o , o '- dgebf reacted significantly only to o , p '- dgebf , but not to the other 2 dgebf isomers or dgeba .	0

leaching of bisphenol a ( bpa ) from polycarbonate plastic to water containing amino acids and its degradation by radical oxygen species .. in this study , ( 1 ) the change in the concentration of bisphenol a ( bpa ) leached from polycarbonate plastic ( pcp ) tube to water samples containing phosphate , sodium barbital , glycine , methionine or albumin at 37 degrees c as a function of time , and ( 2 ) the degradation rate of bpa leached from pcp tube to amino acid solutions in the presence of radical oxygen species ( ros ) were investigated . the bpa leaching velocity ( bpa - lv ) from pcp tube to 50 mm glycine at ph 6 or 7 was twice that to control water , and the leaching was enhanced above ph 8 . at ph 11 , bpa - lv was significantly higher in 50 mm glycine and methionine solutions than in 50 mm naoh . these results indicate that basic ph and amino acids contained in water could accelerate bpa leaching . the bpa - lv in phosphate buffer was different from the bpa - lvs in other buffers ( barbital and glycine ) at the same ph . bpa leached to the glycine or methionine solutions at ph 11 was degraded time dependently in a similar manner as the control water in the presence of ros . the degradation of leached bpa was inhibited in the glycine solution , but was accelerated in the methionine solution . however , degradation of bpa added to freshly prepared methionine was inhibited in a similar manner to bpa in glycine . bpa degradation could be influenced by some kinds of amino acids , but glycine and methionine might be involved in bpa degradation in different ways .	0
monomer elution from nanohybrid and ormocer - based composites cured with different light sources .. objectives : to study monomer elution from four resin - based composites ( rbcs ) cured with different light sources . methods : twenty - eight premolars were randomly allocated to four groups . standardized cavities were prepared and restored with a nanohybrid ( filtek supreme xt or tetric evoceram ), an ormocer ( admira ) or a microhybrid rbc ( filtek z250 ) which served as control . buccal restorations were cured with a halogen and oral restorations with an led light - curing unit . elution of diurethane dimethacrylate ( udma ), bisphenol a diglycidylether methacrylate ( bisgma ), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ) and 2 - hydroxyethyl methacrylate ( hema ) was analyzed using high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) 1h to 28 days post - immersion in 75 % ethanol . data were analyzed using multivariate and repeated measures analysis of variance ( α = 0 . 05 ). results : the greatest elution of udma and bisgma occurred from tetric evoceram and the least from filtek z250 ( p < 0 . 05 ). led and halogen light - curing units gave similar results for all rbcs ( p > 0 . 05 ) except tetric evoceram which showed greater elution for the led unit ( p < 0 . 05 ). tegdma was below the limit of quantification . hema eluted in similar concentrations from filtek supreme and tetric evoceram ( p > 0 . 05 ). significance : the two nanohybrid rbcs eluted more cross - linking monomers than the ormocer and the control microhybrid rbc . continuous elution over 28 days indicates that rbcs act as a chronic source of monomers in clinical conditions . light source may affect monomer elution since differences were found for one out of four rbcs . mathematical models for elution kinetics of udma and bisgma indicated two elution mechanisms .	0
characterization of adsorbed silane on fillers used in dental composite restoratives and its effect on composite properties .. the purpose was to study the effect of silane treatment of fillers on viscosity , flexural strength , and hydrolytic degradation of experimental dental composite resins fabricated with these fillers . the fillers consisted of a mixture of barium glass and amorphous silica . the resin was mainly based on ethoxylated bisphenol a dimethacrylate and polycarbonate dimethacrylate . the adsorption of silane on the filler surface was characterized by ftir . there was significant correlation between the adsorbed silane on filler surface and the silane concentration in silane / methanol solution used for filler treatment . the silane concentration varied from 0 . 75 to 14 % by weight . an increase in silane concentration led to a decrease in viscosities of the corresponding composite resins . the flexural strengths of composites with silanated fillers were greater than that of composites with unsilanated fillers : however , no significant difference was found between the flexural strengths of various silanated groups . the resistance to hydrolytic degradation of different composites increased when the fillers were treated with silane and was the highest at 1 . 1 % silane .	0
bisphenol a depresses compound action potential of frog sciatic nerve in vitro involving ca ( 2 +)- dependent mechanisms .. bisphenol - a ( bpa ), a toxic chemical from polycarbonate plastics , is known for behavioural and neural abnormalities . these neuro - behavioural changes reflect the changes in neural activity . however the effect of bpa on nerve action potential is not available . therefore , present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of bpa on compound action potential ( cap ) of frog sciatic nerve . bundle containing small group of nerve fibres in a sciatic nerve was dissected and placed in a perspex chamber perfused with ringer solution . suction electrodes were applied to the cut ends of the nerve for stimulating and recording purposes . the stimulation of one end ( with supramaximal strength ) produced cap in the recording electrode . bpa ( 1 - 100 μm ) decreased the amplitude and repolarization time of cap in a concentration - dependent manner , without any alteration in latency , rise time and threshold . the decrease in amplitude was directly correlated with decrease in repolarization time ( r = 0 . 76 ). the bpa - induced decreases were absent in ca ( 2 +)- free medium or in presence of l - type ca ( 2 +)- channel antagonist ( nifedipine / deltiazem ). t and p type ca ( 2 +) channel antagonist ( ni ( 2 +)) failed to block the bpa - induced responses . pre - treatment with an erα antagonist ( tamoxifen ) blocked the bpa - induced decrease in cap parameters . these observations indicate that the bpa decreased the amplitude and repolarization time of cap involving l - type ca ( 2 +)- channel dependent mechanisms . further involvement of erα in the modulation of ca ( 2 +) channels is a possibility .	0
bisphenol a diglycidyl ether induces apoptosis in tumour cells independently of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma , in caspase - dependent and - independent manners .. peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( ppars ) are nuclear transcription factors which are involved in many biological processes , such as regulation of cell differentiation , lipid metabolism , inflammation and cell death . ppars consist of three families , ppar - alpha , ppar - delta and ppar - gamma . bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) has been described as a pure antagonist of ppar - gamma . however , recent data also revealed ppar - gamma - agonistic activities of badge . here we show that badge kills transformed cells by apoptosis and promotes the cytotoxic effects of tumour necrosis factor - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( trail ) and indomethacin . the cytotoxic effect of badge does not require ppar - gamma expression and is mediated in caspase - dependent and caspase - independent manners .	0
pre - and postnatal bisphenol a treatment results in persistent deficits in the sexual behavior of male rats , but not female rats , in adulthood .. perinatal administration of the endocrine disruptor bisphenol a ( bpa ) reportedly inhibits the sexual behavior of sexually naïve adult male rats . in order to evaluate the effects of bpa administration during early development on later reproductive behavior , we administered one of five doses of bisphenol a daily to pregnant female rats throughout gestation and lactation , and quantified the appetitive and consummatory sexual behaviors of the resultant male and female offspring over multiple sexual encounters in adulthood . males receiving low dose perinatal bpa ( 50 μg / kg bw / day ) showed persistent deficits in sexual behavior in adulthood . males receiving the highest dose ( 5 mg / kg bw / day ), however , were indistinguishable from controls with respect to consummatory sexual behaviors but showed decreased latencies to engage in those behaviors when sexually naïve , with significant non - linear , or u - shaped , dose - response relationships observed on the first and last day of testing . adult female sexual behavior was not affected by early bpa administration at any dose tested . these results are consistent with previous reports that bpa exerts behavioral effects especially at low doses , and further indicates that bpa can cause lasting impairment of sexual behavior in males , but does not alter the normal development of female appetitive or consummatory sexual behaviors . to our knowledge , this is the first report indicating that adult sexual performance is impaired in sexually experienced animals following perinatal exposure to bisphenol a .	0
impurities in industrial grade 4 , 4 '- isopropylidene diphenol ( bisphenol a ): possible implications for estrogenic activity .. fifteen trace impurities , including a novel cyclohexene derivative , have been identified and quantified in samples of an industrial grade of the oestrogen - active compound 4 , 4 '- isopropylidene diphenol ( bisphenol a ). all of these compounds , like bisphenol a itself , possess phenolic hydroxyl groups para to other substituents and all thus might also have oestrogenic properties . published studies on the endocrine disrupting properties of bisphenol a have not considered potentially active impurities but full assessment of the oestrogenicity of bisphenol a , as it is used commercially , will become possible when adequate supplies of these compounds are available through synthesis .	0
a study of parabens and bisphenol a in surface water and fish brain tissue from the greater pittsburgh area .. pollution from xenoestrogens has been discovered in the aquatic environment of the greater pittsburgh area and is suspected to be caused by the failing sewer system . personal care products and plasticizers have the potential to enter the water supply though treated and untreated sewage . many of these compounds are suspected xenoestrogens . paraben detection in surface waters was as follows : methyl paraben ranged between 2 . 2 to 17 . 3 ppt ; ethyl paraben was not detectable ; propyl paraben was detected at 9 . 2 and 12 . 0 ppt ; butyl paraben was detected at 0 . 2 ppt . bpa was detected between 0 . 6 and 15 . 4 ppt . estrogenic potential of extracts from fish brain tissue was tested via bromodeoxyuridine mcf - 7 analysis and paired with hplc - ms to investigate the presence of xenoestrogens . all samples were non - detectable for parabens . bpa was detected in 44 of the 58 samples , with a range from non - detectable to 120 pg / g . bcfs were calculated . results were statistically significant for location of capture ( p < 0 . 05 ) and correlation existed between estrogenicity and bpa .	0
validation and use of in vivo solid phase micro - extraction ( spme ) for the detection of emerging contaminants in fish .. a variety of emerging chemicals of concern are released continuously to surface water through the municipal wastewater effluent discharges . the ability to rapidly determine bioaccumulation of these contaminants in exposed fish without sacrificing the animal ( i . e . in vivo ) would be of significant advantage to facilitate research , assessment and monitoring of their risk to the environment . in this study , an in vivo solid phase micro - extraction ( spme ) approach was developed and applied to the measurement of a variety of emerging contaminants ( carbamazepine , naproxen , diclofenac , gemfibrozil , bisphenol a , fluoxetine , ibuprofen and atrazine ) in fish . our results indicated in vivo spme was a potential alternative extraction technique for quantitative determination of contaminants in lab exposures and as well after exposure to two municipal wastewater effluents ( mwwe ), with a major advantage over conventional techniques due to its ability to non - lethally sample tissues of living organisms .	0
vortex - assisted liquid - liquid microextraction of octylphenol , nonylphenol and bisphenol - a .. a new and fast equilibrium - based solvent microextraction technique termed vortex - assisted liquid - liquid microextraction ( vallme ) has been developed and used for the trace analysis of octylphenol , nonylphenol and bisphenol - a in water and wastewater samples . according to vallme , dispersion of microvolumes of a low density extractant organic solvent into the aqueous sample is achieved by using for the first time vortex mixing , a mild emulsification procedure . the fine droplets formed could extract target analytes towards equilibrium faster because of the shorter diffusion distance and larger specific surface area . upon centrifugation the floating extractant acceptor phase restored its initial single microdrop shape and was used for high - performance liquid chromatographic analysis . different experimental parameters were controlled and the optimum conditions found were : 50 microl of octanol as the extractant phase ; 20 ml aqueous donor samples ; a 2 min vortex extraction time with the vortex agitator set at a 2500 rpm rotational speed ; centrifugation for 2 min at 3500 rpm ; no ionic strength or ph adjustment . the calculated calibration curves gave high levels of linearity yielding correlation coefficients ( r ( 2 )) greater than 0 . 9935 . the repeatability and reproducibility of the proposed method were found to be good and the limits of the detection were calculated in the low microg l (- 1 ) level ranging between 0 . 01 and 0 . 07 microg l (- 1 ). matrix effects were determined by applying the proposed method to spiked tap , river water and treated municipal wastewater samples . the proposed method was finally applied to the determination of target pollutants in real wastewater effluent samples using the standard addition method .	0
the use of enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) for the determination of pollutants in environmental and industrial wastes .. twelve enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ), for the determination of surfactants [ linear alkylbenzene sulfonates ( las ), alkyl ethoxylates ( ae ), and alkylphenol ethoxylates ( ape )], endocrine disruptors [ alkylphenol ( ap ), ap + ape , and bisphenol a ( bpa )], estrogens [ 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ), estrone ( el ), estrogen ( es : el + e2 + estriol ( e3 )), 1 7alfa - ethynylestradiol ( ee2 )], dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ), were validated on environmental water and industrial wastes . the lowest quantification limits of these elisas were 0 . 05 microg / l ( bpa , e2 , el , es and ee2 ), 2 microg / l ( ae ), 3 microg / l ( dioxins and pcbs ), 5 microg / l ( ap , ap + ape ) and 20 microg / l ( las and ape ). to apply these elisas to environmental or industrial waste samples , simple and appropriate pre - treatment methods were also developed for each elisa . with optimized pre - treatments , the values of elisas were well co - related , in all cases , to those of instrumental analytical methods such as liquid chromatography ( hplc ), liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ), and high - resolution gas chromatography mass spectrometry ( hr - gc - ms ), etc .	0
bond strengths of current adhesive systems on intact and ground enamel .. purpose : the goal of this study was to compare the microshear bond strengths of current adhesive systems to intact and ground enamel surfaces . materials and methods : three commercially adhesive materials were examined : a two - step total - etching self - priming system ( single bond , 3m espe , st . paul , mn , usa ), a two - step self - etching system ( clearfil se bond , kuraray co . ltd ., osaka , japan ), and an all - in - one system ( one - up bond f , tokuyama dental , tokyo , japan ). the labial surfaces of extracted human incisors were used . for intact enamel surfaces , the teeth were polished with pumice . however , for the ground enamel , 0 . 5 mm deep , flat enamel surfaces at the midlabial aspect were ground with a no . 600 grit silicon carbide paper . ground and intact enamel surfaces were bonded with one of three bonding systems and a resin composite and were subjected to a microshear bond test . results : the two self - etching systems demonstrated lower bond strengths than did the total - etching system on intact enamel ( one - up bond f , 18 . 59 mpa ; clearfil se bond , 35 . 71 mpa ; single bond , 47 . 20 mpa ). no significant difference was found between the total - etching system and the two - step self - etching system on ground enamel ( one - up bond f , 28 . 96 mpa ; clearfil se bond , 48 . 51 mpa ; single bond , 51 . 07 mpa ). shear bond strengths on ground enamel were significantly higher than those on intact enamel except for the group that was bonded with the total - etching system . conclusions : the two - step adhesives showed significantly higher bond strengths than did the one - step adhesive . when applying the total - etching system , no significant differences in bond strength were demonstrated between bonding to intact and to ground enamel .	0
chlorhexidine arrests subclinical degradation of dentin hybrid layers in vivo .. the recent paradigm that endogenous collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activities derived from acid - etched dentin result in degradation of hybrid layers requires in vivo validation . this study tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the degradation of dentin bonded with an etch - and - rinse adhesive and that in conjunction with chlorhexidine , an mmp inhibitor , applied after phosphoric - acid - etching . contralateral pairs of bonded class i restorations in primary molars of clinical subjects were retrieved after a six - month period of intra - oral functioning and processed for transmission electron microscopy . hybrid layers from the chlorhexidine - treated teeth exhibited normal structural integrity of the collagen network . conversely , abnormal hybrid layers were seen in the control teeth , with progressive disintegration of the fibrillar network , to the extent that it was beyond detection by collagen staining . self - destruction of collagen matrices occurs rapidly in resin - infiltrated dentin in vivo and may be arrested with the use of chlorhexidine as an mmp inhibitor .	0
the environmental estrogen bisphenol a stimulates prolactin release in vitro and in vivo .. environmental estrogens ( xenoestrogens ) are a diverse group of chemicals that mimic estrogenic actions . bisphenol a ( bpa ), a monomer of plastics used in many consumer products , has estrogenic activity in vitro . the pituitary lactotroph is a well established estrogen - responsive cell . the overall objective was to examine the effects of bpa on prl release and explore its mechanism of action . the specific aims were to : 1 ) compare the potency of estradiol and bpa in stimulating prl gene expression and release in vitro ; 2 ) determine whether bpa increases prl release in vivo ; 3 ) examine if the in vivo estrogenic effects are mediated by prl regulating factor from the posterior pituitary ; and 4 ) examine if bpa regulates transcription through the estrogen response element ( ere ). bpa increased prl gene expression , release , and cell proliferation in anterior pituitary cells albeit at a 1000 - to 5000 - fold lower potency than estradiol . on the other hand , bpa had similar efficacy to estradiol in inducing hyperprolactinemia in estrogen - sensitive fischer 344 ( f344 ) rats ; sprague dawley ( sd ) rats did not respond to bpa . posterior pituitary cells from estradiol - or bpa - treated f344 rats strongly increased prl gene expression upon coculture with gh3 cells stably transfected with a reporter gene . similar to estradiol , bpa induced ere activation in transiently transfected anterior and posterior pituitary cells . we conclude that : a ) bpa mimics estradiol in inducing hyperprolactinemia in genetically predisposed rats ; b ) the in vivo action of estradiol and bpa in f344 rats is mediated , at least in part , by increasing prl regulating factor activity in the posterior pituitary ; c ) bpa appears to regulate transcription through an ere , suggesting that it binds to estrogen receptors in both the anterior and posterior pituitaries . the possibility that bpa and other xenoestrogens have adverse effects on the neuroendocrine axis in susceptible human subpopulations is discussed .	0
bisphenol a : how the most relevant exposure sources contribute to total consumer exposure .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is an endocrine disrupting chemical that is found in human urine throughout industrial societies around the globe . consumer exposure pathways to bpa include packaged food , household dust , air , and dental fillings . to date , information on the relative contribution of the different pathways to total consumer exposure is lacking , but is key for managing substance - associated risks . we investigated the relative contributions of the pathways known to be most relevant for nine different consumer groups . our results suggest that the most important pathways for infants and children are the use of polycarbonate ( pc ) baby bottles and for adults and teenagers the consumption of canned food . dental surgery can also considerably contribute over a short time directly after the surgery . for infants fed with pc baby bottles with mean dose rates of 0 . 8 microg / kg ( bw )/ d the highest exposure dose rate was calculated . this dose rate is far below the tolerable daily intake of 50 microg / kg ( bw )/ d . however , it is of the same order of magnitude as recently reported concentrations that caused low - dose health effects in rodents . we find a pattern of falling exposure levels with rising age that is supported by urinary concentrations of bpa available for selected consumer groups . similarly , the exposure levels we predict are confirmed by the levels reported in these studies .	0
rat two - generation reproductive toxicity study of bisphenol a .. this study was conducted to determine the low - dose effects of bisphenol a ( bpa ) in a rat two - generation reproduction study . groups of 25 male and 25 female crj : cd ( sd ) igs rats were given bpa at 0 . 2 , 2 , 20 , or 200 microg / kg / day by gastric intubation throughout the study beginning at the onset of a 10 - and 2 - week premating period , in f0 males and females , respectively , and continuing through the mating , gestation , and lactation periods , for two generations . there were adult ( f0 , f1 , f2 ) and postnatal day ( pnd ) 22 ( f1 , f2 ) necropsies : the oldest f2 males and females being killed at postnatal weeks 7 and 14 , respectively . no compound - related clinical signs or effects on body weight or food consumption were observed in any generation . there were no compound - related changes in surface righting reflex , negative geotaxis reflex , mid - air righting reflex , pinna detachment , incisor eruption , eye opening , testes descent , preputial separation , or vaginal opening in f1 and f2 generations , or behavior in the open field or water filled multiple t - maze in the f1 generation . no test compound - related changes in estrous cyclicity , copulation index , fertility index , number of implantations , gestation length , litter size , pup weight , pup sex ratio , pup viability , or other functional reproductive measures were noted in any generation . a few significant changes in the anogenital distance ( agd ) per cube root of body weight ratio were found at 0 . 2 and 20 microg / kg in f1 males , at 2 , 20 , and 200 microg / kg in f1 females , and at 20 and 200 microg / kg in f2 females . however , the changes in the agd were consistently small ( within 5 % of control values ), and no continuous changes in the agd or agd / cube root of body weight ratio were detected . there were no compound - related changes in epididymal sperm counts or motility in f0 and f1 males . no compound - related necropsy findings or effects on organ weight including the reproductive organs were found in any generation . histopathologic examinations revealed no evidence of compound - related changes in any organs including the reproductive organs of both sexes . the data indicate that oral doses of bpa of between 0 . 2 and 200 microg / kg over 2 generations did not cause significant compound - related changes in reproductive or developmental parameters in rats .	0
migration of bisphenol a ( bpa ) from epoxy can coatings to jalapeño peppers and an acid food simulant .. effects of heat processing , storage time , and temperature on migration of bisphenol a ( bpa ) from an epoxy type can coating to an acid food simulant and jalapeño peppers were determined . commercial jalapeño pepper cans ( 8 oz , dimensions 211 x 300 ) were stored at 25 degrees c for 40 , 70 , and 160 days . a solution of 3 % acetic acid was canned in 211 x 300 cans from the same batch used for jalapeño peppers . heat processing was applied to two - thirds of the cans , and the remaining cans were not heat processed . cans were stored at 25 and 35 degrees c for 0 , 40 , 70 , and 160 days . results showed that there is a minimal effect of heat treatment . an effect of storage time on migration of bpa during the first 40 days at 25 degrees c was observed . an increase on migration of bpa was observed with storage time at 35 degrees c . the highest level of migration was 15 . 33 microg / kg of bpa at 160 days at 35 degrees c . a correction factor of approximately 0 . 4 was calculated for migration under simulating conditions of storage compared to the real ones . the highest level of bpa found in jalapeño peppers cans , surveyed from three supermarkets , was 5 . 59 +/- 2 . 43 microg / kg . migration of bpa , performed according to the european and mercosur conditions , was 65 . 45 +/- 5 . 29 microg / kg . all the migration values found in this study were below those legislation limits ( 3 mg / kg ).	0

decreased androgen receptor expression may contribute to spermatogenesis failure in rats exposed to low concentration of bisphenol a .. to investigate the effects of a low bisphenol a ( bpa ) concentration on male reproduction , adult rats were administered a concentration of bpa that was less than the no observable adverse effect level ( 0 . 0005 - 5 mg / kg / bw ) for 8 weeks . general toxicity , reproductive hormones , and spermatogenesis were then determined . the expression of genes related to hormone synthesis and spermatogenesis was also analyzed . these bpa concentrations generated no general toxicity and no significant changes on serum hormones . however , the testicular testosterone , hormone synthesis - related genes star and cyp450scc increased , whereas 3β - hsd , 17β - hsd , and cyp450arom decreased . additionally , bpa significantly decreased the epithelial height and round spermatids in seminiferous tubules , sperm count , androgen receptor expression , and the expression of the spermatogenesis - related genes outer dense fiber protein 1 ( odf1 ) and transition protein 1 . our results indicate that a low bpa concentration can induce spermatogenesis disorders mainly through decreasing androgen receptor expression . the present results may bring attention to the risk of environmental bpa exposure .	0

the retention of threaded pins in composite resin .. the force required to remove three threaded retention pins from composite resin and the pin length for optimum retention were determined . tms minuta , tms minikin , and tms minim pins were tested . composite resin materials used were representative of large particle , small particle , and microfilled type materials . results demonstrate that the minim pin of 2 mm length is the optimum pin for use with large - and small - particle composite resin . however , microfilled composite resin requires a 2 . 25 mm length of the minim pin for optimum retention . minuta and minikin pins are removed with only a small amount of force and should be used only when clinical prudence requires a small pin . when these tiny pins are used , the strongest possible composite resin should be selected .	0
porcelain - to - composite bond strengths using four organosilane materials .. the flexural strengths of porcelain bonded to composite resin specimens using four organosilane materials were compared . eighty hand - condensed vita porcelain specimens were stored in distilled water or ambient humidity before sectioning . three groups ( n = 30 ) of hydrated specimens were repaired to their original dimensions by using silux composite resin with kerr ultrafine porcelain repair bonding system , 3m porcelain kit with scotchprimer , or fusion materials . a fourth group ( n = 30 ) of hydrated specimens was repaired with the denmat ultrabond restorative kit . four groups ( n = 10 ) of unhydrated specimens were repaired the same as the hydrated specimens . fracture occurred at the porcelain - to - composite resin interface with three - point loading on the repair interface at 3 x 10 ( 2 ) mm / min . no difference between kerr , 3m , and fusion products , when used with silux composite resin , was found . the denmat product had lower strengths . the unhydrated specimens had significantly higher bond strengths than the hydrated specimens with all products .	0
effect of restorative materials on cuspal flexure .. the purposes of this study were ( 1 ) to establish a methodology for determining surface strains in two locations of the same tooth under intact , prepared , and restored conditions and ( 2 ) to compare the effects on stiffness of different restorative materials in a tooth subjected to cuspal loading . two linear strain gauges were mounted on each of 30 extracted maxillary premolar teeth . teeth were mounted in poly ( methyl methacrylate ) resin and randomly assigned to one of three study groups according to the restorative material and application technique to be used . statistical analysis indicated a statistically significant interaction between restorative material and tooth condition at both proximal and buccal sites and a statistically significant difference in stiffness between teeth restored with tenure / marathon v and those restored with either amalgam or scotchbond 2 / p - 50 at the proximal site . results suggest that the methods employed provide a useful , nondestructive means of testing the same tooth under various conditions .	0
"""effect of removal of surface collagen fibrils on resin - dentin bonding .. objectives : the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of naocl at removing the demineralized layer by examining the morphology of the hybrid layer and measuring shear bond strengths after different dentin treatments . methods : dentin disks were treated with : ( 1 ) 35 % phosphoric acid ( pa ) 20 s ; ( 2 ) pa treatment followed by 1 . 5 % naocl , 2 min ; ( 3 ) pa treatment , followed by a 10 % naocl immersion for 120 h . sem was used to analyze the morphology of dentin and its interface with dentin bonding agents ( dbas ), while shear bond strength tests were used to measure adhesion . all specimens were then fractured into two halves : one half was inspected under sem ; the other half was sequentially placed in 10 % pa followed by 12 . 5 % naocl for 70 h , to remove all dentin from the resin replica of the original bonded interface . results : sem observations showed that collagen fibrils were completely removed from the acid - etched surface by naocl treatment . the diameter and the size of dentinal tubules and the number of lateral branches of the tubules were increased following naocl treatment . naocl applied on dentin smear layers did not significantly modify their sem morphology . resin tags were larger in diameter after phosphoric acid / naocl treatment than after only phosphoric acid treatment . resin - infiltrated dentin - layers were only observed after the single phosphoric acid ( i . e . conventional etching ) procedure , and were not observed after combined phosphoric acid / naocl treatment . etched / naocl samples showed a lower bond strength using scotchbond mp and 3m single bond , but were higher in optibond fl and unmodified in prime & bond 2 . 0 groups when compared with acid - etched controls . treatment of etched dentin with naocl for 120 h produced an unusual type of resin infiltration of mineralized dentin that could be called a """" reverse hybrid layer """" which may explain the mechanism of resin bonding to naocl treated dentin . significance : the use of acidic conditioners for exposure of the collagen matrix exposes a soft delicate mesh that can collapse , thereby interfering with resin infiltration . if acid - etching is followed by naocl treatment , high bond strengths can be achieved via """" reverse hybrid layer """" formation , a proposed new mechanism of micromechanical resin retention . this mechanism is not yet recommended for clinical use but demonstrates a new type of resin retention ."""	0

interaction of bisphenol a with rat hepatic cytochrome p450 enzymes .. the effect of bisphenol a ( bpa ) on the kinetics of cytochrome p450 ( p450 )- dependent monooxygenases in rat liver microsomes was studied . testosterone 16beta - hydroxylase ( ts16bh ) and testosterone 2alpha - hydroxylase ( ts2ah ) activities were extensively inhibited by bpa at 100 microm ( 69 % and 74 %, respectively ). the inhibition type was mixed for both p450 - dependent monooxyganases . the ki of ts16bh and ts2ah from lineweaver - burk plots were 25 . 9 and 24 . 9 microm , respectively . the activities of acetanilide 4 - hydroxylase ( aa4h ), 7 - ethoxycoumarin o - deethylase ( ecod ), bufuralol 1 '- hydroxylase ( bf1 ' h ), chlorzoxazone 6 - hydroxylase ( cz6h ) and testosterone 6beta - hydroxylase ( ts6bh ) were also effectively inhibited by bpa at 100 microm ( 43 - 52 %). the inhibition type of these p450 - dependent monooxygenases was mixed or uncompetitive , and the k ( i ) s ( 50 . 5 - 88 . 5 microm ) were higher than those of ts16bh and ts2ah . by contrast , the values of ic50 and ki of testosterone 7alpha - hydroxylase ( ts7ah ) and lauric acid omega - hydroxylase ( laoh ) for bpa were > 1000 microm . these results suggest that bpa interacts with rat hepatic cyp1a2 , cyp2a2 , cyp2b2 , cyp2c11 , cyp2d1 , cyp2e1 and cyp3a2 in vitro .	0
effects of perinatal exposure to bisphenol a on the behavior of offspring in f344 rats .. the objective of this investigation is to evaluate whether perinatal maternal exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) at 4 , 40 , and 400 mg / kg per day affects the behavior of offspring in f344 rats . perinatal bpa exposure inhibited the body weight increases of male and female offspring in a dose - dependent manner , which continued after weaning . spontaneous activity analyses revealed that bpa elongated immobile time during the dark phase in female offspring . at 4 weeks of age , male offspring exposed to bpa at 40 and 400 mg / kg per day performed avoidance responses significantly higher in the shuttlebox avoidance test . at 8 weeks of age , however , male offspring only at 4 mg / kg per day showed significantly lower responses . in the open - field behavior test at 8 weeks of age , male offspring exposed to bpa only at 4 mg / kg per day showed a higher percent of grooming than the control male offspring . in conclusion , perinatal exposure to bpa caused the behavioral alterations in the offspring .	0
in vitro cytotoxicity of solid epoxy - based dental resins and their components .. objective : the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding a spiroorthocarbonate ( soc ) or a polyol on the cytotoxicity of epoxy - based dental resins . methods : resins contained one of the epoxies : diglycidyl ether bisphenol a ( gy - 6004 ); 3 , 4 - epoxycyclohexanemethyl - 3 , 4 - epoxycyclohexane carboxylate ( uvr - 6105 ); vinyl cyclohexane dioxide ( erl - 4206 ) or the three - epoxy mixture ( epoxy - m ). the soc was t / t - 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 - di ( tetramethylene )- 1 , 5 , 7 , 11 - tetraoxaspiro [ 5 . 5 ] undecane ( soc ). the polyols were polytetrahydrofuran ( p - thf - 250 ) and polycaprolactone triol ( tone - 301 ). the photoinitiator ( 4 - octylphenyl ) phenyliodonium hexafluoroantimonate and camphorquinone were used for light curing the resins . four types of resins ( epoxy , soc / epoxy , polyol / epoxy and soc / polyol / epoxy ) were evaluated for cytotoxicity as solids in the agar diffusion assay and as aqueous extracts in the mtt assay using l929 cells . results : in agar diffusion analysis , erl - 4206 and uvr - 6105 resins were severely cytotoxic (+ 3 ), but the addition of soc changed them to non - cytotoxic (-). addition of 1 - 3 % soc changed epoxy - m from mild (+) to non - cytotoxic . adding soc changed gy - 6004 from moderate (+ 2 ) to mild (-) cytotoxicity . generally , addition of soc did not change cytotoxicity when added to polyol / epoxy combinations . either polyol produced resins with reduced cytotoxicity when added to uvr - 6105 , but the opposite occurred when added to epoxy - m resins . in mtt analysis , percent cell survival from 100 microliters resin extracts were statistically compared ( anova , p < 0 . 05 ). epoxy - m and gy - 6004 resin extracts were significantly less cytotoxic than uvr - 6105 and erl - 4206 resin extracts were . overall , the soc component reduced the cytotoxicity of all soc / epoxy combinations , except soc / erl - 4206 , which was significantly more cytotoxic than erl - 4206 resin extract . this may be the result of cell fixative effects observed for soc / erl - 4206 in agar diffusion analysis . addition of soc produced significantly less cytotoxic soc / polyol / epoxy - m resins when compared to its non - soc counterpart . the contrary result was obtained with soc / polyol / uvr - 6105 resin combinations . consistent with agar diffusion results , adding polyol significantly decreased cytotoxicity of uvr - 6105 resins . the cytotoxicity of these resins may be related to the 50 % cytotoxicity ( tc50 ) of their components as leachates . the tc50 values of the individual components were compared to bisgma . polyols , epoxy monomers , soc monomer and camphorquinone were significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) less cytotoxic than bisgma . significance : addition of socs and polyols in the formulation of epoxy - based resins may contribute to development of biocompatible dental composites .	0
occurrence of endocrine disruption chemicals ( bisphenol a , 4 - nonylphenol , and octylphenol ) in muscle and liver of , cyprinus carpino common , from anzali wetland , iran .. phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals are environmental pollutants with xenostrogen effects in wildlife and humans . the aim of this study was to determine 4 - nonylphenol , octylphenol , and bisphenol a residues in various tissues of carp fish samples from anzali wetland , iran . 4 - np , op , and bpa were detected with gc - ms in the muscle of fish from sampling location with maximal concentrations of 8 . 17 , 9 . 67 and 5 . 87 μg / gdw , respectively . the highest concentrations of these compounds were found in the liver by hplc . since many endocrine disrupting substances were significantly lipophilic , distributing of these compounds into fish tissue has been correlated with lipid content .	0
set , a putative oncogene , as a biomarker for prenatal exposure to bisphenol a .. background : bisphenol a ( bpa ), an endocrine disrupting chemical , has been suspected to pose carcinogenic risks . however , likely mechanisms are obscure and there are difficulties to estimating its real significance for cancer development . methods : we therefore studied bpa - induced proteomic alterations in immune organs of icr mice offspring that were prenatally exposed to bpa ( 15 and 300 mg / l of drinking water ). we performed 2d - gel analyses of samples , considering differences in spleen , exposure levels , sex , and ages . results : from proteomic analyses , we found various proteins were up - or down - regulated by bpa . among them , set , a putative oncogene and inhibitor of phosphatase 2a , was significantly down - regulated in a bpa dose - dependent manner . we also confirmed down - regulation of set in western blot and real time pcr analyses . from gene network analysis , set is predicted to communicate with other genes including cyp17 , which is involved in biosynthesis and metabolism of sex - hormones . conclusions : this study provided evidence that set can be applied as a new biomarker for prenatal bpa exposure and suggests a potential new mechanism of action in that bpa may disrupt cyp17 via set .	0
compatibility between an all - in - one self - etching adhesive and a dual - cured resin luting cement .. purpose : to determine if bonding incompatibility between a single - step self - etching adhesive and a dual - cured luting cement is prevented by addition of deprotonizing anion exchange resin powder to the amine component of the resin cement . materials and methods : ibond adhesive ( ibo ) ( heraeus kulzer ) and the dual - cured resin cement twinlook ( twi ) ( heraeus kulzer ) were used with base pastes , containing 0 , 1 , 2 , and 4 wt % anion exchange resin ( aer ) in oh - form . conventional shear bond strength ( sbs ) was determined on human dentin . after application of ibo , a cylindrical mold was clamped on the treated surface and bulk filled with twi . sbs was measured after 24 h in 37degrees c water at a crosshead speed of 1 mm / min . the following curing protocols were investigated : group 1 : ibo not light cured , twi redox cured ; group 2 : ibo light cured , twi redox - cured ; group 3 : ibo light cured , twi dual cured ( n = 8 ). the data were statistically analyzed using anova and duncan ' s post - hoc test at alpha < 0 . 05 . results : the mean sbss ( mpa ) with original twi in groups 1 , 2 , and 3 were 12 . 7aa , 16 . 4ba , and 24 . 7ca . the corresponding figures for 1 % aer were : 16 . 6ab , 23 . 0bb , 22 . 8ba ; for 2 % aer : 16 . 8ab , 22 . 6abb , 24 . 6ba ; and for 4 % aer : 16 . 2aab , 22 . 5bb , 24 . 7ba . different small and capital letters denote significant differences by treatment group and by aer content , respectively . conclusion : addition of anion exchange resin to the amine component of the dual - cured resin cement enhances the bond strength to dentin upon redox curing by prevention of amine neutralization through functional acid monomers from an all - in - one adhesive , mainly when the adhesive or the luting cement were not light cured .	0
rheological properties of resin composites according to variations in monomer and filler composition .. objectives : the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of monomer and filler composition on the rheological properties related to the handling characteristics of composites . methods : a resin matrix in which bis - gma was blended with tegdma at a ratio of 6 : 4 , was mixed with silane - treated barium glass ( 0 . 7 and 1 . 0 microm ), 0 . 04 microm fumed silica or 0 . 5 microm round silica . the type and content of incorporated fillers were varied to achieve different viscosity levels of the experimental composites . steady shear and dynamic oscillatory shear tests were performed with a rheometer . the viscosity ( eta ) of the resin matrix , the storage shear modulus ( g '), loss modulus ( g ''), complex modulus ( g *), loss tangent ( tandelta ), phase angle delta and complex viscosity ( eta *) of the composites were evaluated as a function of frequency omega = 0 . 1 - 100 rad / s . to investigate the effect of temperature on viscosity , a temperature sweep test was also performed . results : resin matrices were newtonian fluids and all experimental composites exhibited pseudoplasticity . the viscosity exponentially increased as the percentage of filler volume was increased , but decreased with increasing temperature . for identical filler volumes , as the filler size decreased , viscosity increased . the effect of filler size on the viscosity was intensified with increasing filler content , and the increased filler content reduced the tandelta . significance : the rheological properties of composites related to handling characteristics were greatly influenced by the formulation of the monomer and filler , shear rate and temperature . the locus of frequency domain phasor plots , g (*)( omega ) e ( idelta )= g (*)( omega ) angledelta , in a complex plane was a valuable method for representing the viscoelastic properties of the composites .	0
effects of in utero exposure to bisphenol a or diethylstilbestrol on the adult male reproductive system .. the objective of this study was to determine whether in utero exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) induced reproductive tract abnormalities in the adult male testis . using the c57 / bl6 mouse , we examined sex - organ weights , anogenital distance , and testis histopathology in adult males exposed in utero via oral gavage to sesame oil , 50 µg / kg bpa , 1000 µg / kg bpa , or 2 µg / kg diethylstilbestrol ( des ) as a positive control from gestational days 10 to 16 . no changes in sperm production or germ cell apoptosis were observed in adult testes after exposure to either chemical . adult mrna levels of genes associated with sexual maturation and differentiation , gata4 and id2 , were significantly lower only in des - exposed testes . in summary , the data indicate no gross alterations in spermatogenesis after in utero exposure to bpa or des . at the molecular level , in utero exposure to des , but not bpa , leads to decreased mrna expression of genes associated with sertoli cell differentiation .	0
cytotoxic effects of current dental adhesive systems on immortalized odontoblast cell line mdpc - 23 .. objectives : evaluate the cytotoxic effect of the three dental adhesive systems . methods : the immortalized mouse odontoblast cell line ( mdpc - 23 ) was plated ( 30 , 000 cell / cm2 ) in 24 well dishes , allowed to grow for 72 h , and counted under inverted light microscopy . uncured fresh adhesives were added to culture medium to simulate effects of unset adhesive . three adhesives systems were applied for 120 min to cells in six wells for each group : group 1 ) single bond ( 3m ), group 2 ) prime & bond 2 . 1 ( dentsply ), and group 3 ) syntac sprint ( vivadent ). in the control group , pbs was added to fresh medium . the cell number was counted again and the cell morphology was assessed under sem . in addition , the adhesive systems were applied to circles of filter paper , light - cured for 20 s , and placed in the bottom of 24 wells ( six wells for each experimental materials and control group ). mdpc - 23 cells were plated ( 30 , 000 cell / cm2 ) in the wells and allowed to incubate for 72 h . the zone of inhibition around the filter papers was measured under inverted light microscopy ; cell morphology was evaluated under sem ; and the mtt assay was performed for mitochondrial respiration . results : the fresh adhesives exhibited more toxic ( cytopathic effects ) to mdpc - 23 cells than polymerized adhesives on filter papers , and as compared to the control group . the cytopathic effect of the adhesive systems occurred in the inhibition zone around the filter papers , which was confirmed by the mtt assay and statistical analysis ( anova ) combined with fisher ' s plsd test . in the control group , mdpc - 23 cells were dense on the plastic substrate and were in contact with the filter paper . in the experimental groups , when acid in the adhesive systems was removed by changing the culture medium , or when the adhesives were light - cured , some cells grew in the wells in spite of the persistent cytotoxic effect . significance : all dentin adhesive systems were cytotoxic odontoblast - like cells . both acidity and non - acidic components of these systems were responsible for the high cytopathic effect of those dental materials .	0
the male mammary gland : a target for the xenoestrogen bisphenol a .. males of some strains of mice retain their mammary epithelium even in the absence of nipples . here , we have characterized the mammary gland in male cd - 1 mice both in whole mounts and histological sections . we also examined the effects of bisphenol a ( bpa ), an estrogen mimic that alters development of the female mouse mammary gland . bpa was administered at a range of environmentally relevant doses ( 0 . 25 - 250μg / kg / day ) to pregnant and lactating mice and then the mammary glands of male offspring were examined at several periods in adulthood . we observed age - and dose - specific effects on mammary gland morphology , indicating that perinatal bpa exposures alter the male mammary gland in adulthood . these results may provide insight into gynecomastia , the most common male breast disease in humans , where proliferation of the mammary epithelium leads to breast enlargement .	0
the effect of various surface coatings on fluoride release from glass - ionomer cement .. to protect glass - ionomer cement from moisture contamination and dehydration during initial setting , immediate application of a surface coating agent is recommended . this study compared the effect of various surface coatings on f release from glass - ionomer cement . twenty glass - ionomer cement ( ketac fil aplicap ) disks ( 4 . 52 cm2 ) were prepared from a teflon mold . the control group was uncoated , while the experimental groups were coated with visiobond , scotchbond ii , and ketac varnish . in addition , five specimens of variglass were similarly prepared and remained uncoated as per the manufacturer ' s instructions . f release was measured each day during week 1 and on the last day of weeks 2 , 3 , and 4 . the results indicated that the application of the surface coatings did not completely inhibit f release from glass - ionomer cements , and that f release during the first week for all groups was significantly greater than in the subsequent 3 weeks . visiobond - coated glass - ionomer cement allowed significantly more f release than scotchbond ii - coated glass - ionomer cement , ketac varnish - coated glass - ionomer cement , or variglass .	0
wet air oxidation of epoxy acrylate monomer industrial wastewater .. epoxy acrylate monomer industrial wastewater contained highly concentrated and toxic organic compounds . the wet air oxidation ( wao ) and catalytic wet air oxidation ( cwao ) were used to eliminate pollutants in order to examine the feasibility of the wao / cwao as a pre - treatment method for the industrial wastewater . the results showed that in the wao 63 % chemical oxygen demand ( cod ) and 41 % total organic carbon ( toc ) removals were achieved and biological oxygen demand ( bod ( 5 ))/ cod ratio increased from 0 . 13 to 0 . 72 after 3h reaction at 250 degrees c , 3 . 5mpa and the initial concentration of 100g ( cod )/ l . among homogenous catalysts ( cu ( 2 +), fe ( 2 +), fe ( 3 +) and mn ( 2 +) salts ), cu ( 2 +) salt exhibited better performance . cuo catalyst was used in the cwao of the wastewater , cod and toc conversion were 77 and 54 %, and good biodegradability was achieved . the results proved that the cwao was an effective pre - treatment method for the epoxy acrylate monomer industrial wastewater .	0
nanoleakage : leakage within the hybrid layer .. most microleakage studies involve quantitating the magnitude of movement of a tracer molecule through a gap between restorative materials and the wall of cavity preparations . the present microscopic study examined the migration of silver nitrate into the interface between dentin and five different dentin bonding agents used to restore class 5 cavities , in the absence of gap formation . several different leakage patterns were seen , but they all indicated leakage within the hybrid layer when viewed by sem . the ranking of microleakage from most to least was : all - bond 2 > suberbond c & b > scotchbond multi - purpose > clearfil liner bond system > kuraray experimental system , kb - 200 . to distinguish this special type of microleakage within the basal , porous region of the hybrid layer in the absence of gap formation , we propose the term nanoleakage .	0
pullout bond strength of fiber posts luted to different depths and submitted to artificial aging .. introduction : the extension of fiber post cementation often does not seem to influence the fracture resistance of restorations . this study evaluated the effects of cementation depths on the retention of fiber posts submitted to artificial aging . methods : one hundred and sixty bovine incisors were selected to assess post retention . following endodontic treatment , the canals were flared with diamonds burs . postholes were prepared in lengths of 5 or 10 mm , after which fiber posts were relined with composite resin and luted with relyx arc or relyx unicem . the samples were then submitted to thermal and / or mechanical cycling before testing their pullout bond strengths . absence of cycling was used as a control . the results of each cement were submitted to two - way and post hoc tukey tests ( α = 0 . 05 ). results : independent of the aging protocol , a depth of 10 mm showed higher pullout bond strength than did 5 mm , except for relyx unicem without cycling . for relyx arc , thermomechanical cycling resulted in lower values than in the absence of cycling . mechanical cycling alone promoted the highest bond strength when the posts were luted with relyx unicem . conclusion : the effect of artificial aging on the pullout bond strength is dependent on the type of material and the depth .	0
effect of chlorhexidine and ethanol on the durability of the adhesion of the fiber post relined with resin composite to the root canal .. introduction : the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pretreatment of gel chlorhexidine and ethanol on the bond strength and durability of the adhesion of the fiber post relined with resin composite to the root dentin . methods : sixty bovine incisor roots were divided into four groups : irrigation with physiologic solution ( control ), 5 minutes with chlorhexidine , 1 minute with ethanol , and 5 minutes with chlorhexidine followed by 1 minute with ethanol . fiber posts relined with resin composite were cemented with relyx arc ( 3m espe , st paul , mn ) and a self - etching adhesive system clearfil se bond ( kuraray , kurashiki , japan ). each group was randomly divided into three subgroups : 24 hours of water storage , 12 months of water storage , and 12 months of oil storage . all roots were sectioned transversely in the coronal , middle , and apical regions , producing 1 - mm thick slices , and the push - out test was performed . statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and the tukey test for post hoc comparisons ( α = 0 . 05 ). results : immediate groups showed similar bond strength values with or without chlorhexidine and / or ethanol pretreatment ( p > . 05 ). a significant decrease in the bond strength in the control group was observed after 12 months of storage in water and oil ( p < . 05 ). the use of chlorhexidine - and / or ethanol - preserved bond strength in the groups stored in water and oil for 12 months ( p < . 05 ). conclusions : chlorhexidine and / or ethanol pretreatment were capable of preserving the bond strength of the fiber post relined with resin composite to root dentin for 12 months .	0
factors associated with clinical success of cervical abrasion / erosion restorations .. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of class 5 restorations according to usphs criteria . twenty - five patients and 116 abrasion / erosion lesions were restored with either a glass - ionomer cement restoration ( ketac - fil ), a composite resin restoration with a dentin bonding agent ( silux plus , scotchbond 2 ), or a composite resin restoration with a dentin bonding agent and a glass - ionomer liner ( silux plus , scotchbond 2 , vitrebond ). at 3 years , 24 patients and 110 teeth were evaluated . all restorations were rated clinically acceptable for color match , cavosurface discoloration , surface texture , and caries development . glass - ionomer cement restorations demonstrated a slightly rougher surface texture than the composite restorations ( friedman two - way anova , p = 0 . 000 ). significant differences were found with retention ( cochran q test , p = 0 . 012 ). percentages retained were : glass ionomer , 97 . 3 % ( 36 / 37 ); composite / dentin bonding agent , 75 . 7 % ( 28 / 37 ); composite / dentin bonding agent / glass - ionomer liner , 100 % ( 36 / 36 ). at 3 years class 5 restorations of glass - ionomer cement or composite with a dentin bonding and a glass - ionomer liner demonstrated significantly better retention than restorations of composite with a dentin bonding agent . increased occlusal function , mobility , and mandibular arch were associated with a decrease in retention rate .	0
shear bond strengths of composite to dentin using six dental adhesive systems .. the development of adhesive agents for bonding composite to dentin has rapidly evolved in recent years . it is postulated that dentin bond strengths in the range of 17 mpa are sufficient to resist the polymerization shrinkage of composite resins . the purpose of this study was to evaluate the shear bond strengths of the following dentin adhesive systems : all - bond 2 ( bisco ), imperva bond ( shofu ), optibond ( kerr ), permagen ( ultradent ), probond ( caulk / dentsply ), and scotchbond multi - purpose ( 3m ). sixty human molars ( 10 per group ) were mounted in phenolic rings , and the occlusal surfaces were flat ground in dentin to 600 grit . the prepared dentin bonding sites were treated according to the directions for each of the systems evaluated . a gelatin capsule technique was used to bond bis - fil composite cylinders to the teeth . the specimens were stored in water at 37 degrees c for 24 hours . mean shear bond strengths were as follows : scotchbond multi - purpose : 23 . 1 +/- 2 . 6 mpa , all - bond 2 : 21 . 4 +/- 7 . 8 mpa , imperva bond : 19 . 8 +/- 6 . 1 mpa , optibond : 19 . 7 +/- 3 . 6 mpa , probond : 16 . 3 +/- 4 . 5 mpa , and permagen : 16 . 2 +/- 3 . 0 mpa . there was not a significant difference ( p < 0 . 05 ) in the bond strengths of scotchbond multi - purpose , all - bond 2 , imperva bond , and optibond . the bond strengths of scotchbond multi - purpose and all - bond 2 were significantly greater ( p < 0 . 05 ) than probond and permagen . current - generation dentin adhesive systems have approached or exceeded the theoretical threshold value to resist contraction stresses during polymerization of resin materials .	0
differential effects of octylphenol , 17beta - estradiol , endosulfan , or bisphenol a on the steroidogenic competence of cultured adult rat leydig cells .. in the current studies , we evaluated the effects of 4 - tert - octylphenol ( op ), endosulfan , bisphenol a ( bpa ), and 17beta - estradiol on basal or hcg - stimulated testosterone formation by cultured leydig cells from young adult male rats . exposure of leydig cells to increasing concentrations of op ( 1 to 2000 nm ), 17beta - estradiol ( 1 to 1000 nm ), endosulfan ( 1 to 1000 nm ) or bpa ( 1 to 1000 nm ), alone or with 10 miu / ml hcg for 4 or 24 h , did not lower ambient testosterone levels , although cells exposed to higher op concentrations + hcg for 24 h often had modest declines in testosterone ( 10 to 20 %). of interest , exposure to the highest concentration op ( 2000 nm ) alone for 4 or 24 h increased testosterone levels ( approximately 2 - fold in 4 - h exposed cells ). whether prior exposure to op + hcg for 24 h affects the subsequent conversion of steroid substrates to testosterone over 4 h was evaluated . progressive declines in 1 microm 22 ( r ) hydroxycholesterol , 1 microm pregnenolone , or 1 microm progesterone conversion to testosterone was observed beginning at 100 to 500 nm op exposure ( maximal declines of 40 to 12 % of controls were observed ); however , the conversion of 1 microm androstenedione to testosterone was not affected by op . these results suggested that 24 - h exposure to op + hcg has no effect on 17beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , which converts androstenedione to testosterone , but that it inhibits the 17alpha - hydroxylase / c17 - 20 lyase step , which converts progesterone to androstenedione . in addition , potentially , op could inhibit cholesterol side / chain cleavage activity , which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone , and / or 3beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , which converts pregnenolone to progesterone . of interest , exposure to increasing concentrations of 17beta - estradiol ( 1 to 1000 nm ), endosulfan ( 1 to 1000 nm ), or bpa ( 1 to 1000 nm ) + hcg for 24 h had no effect on subsequent conversion of 22 ( r ) hydroxycholesterol to testosterone . furthermore , the inhibiting effects of op + hcg exposure on subsequent conversion of progesterone to testosterone was unaffected by concomitant exposure to the pure estrogen antagonist , ici 182 , 780 , or the antioxidants , ascorbate or dimethyl sulfoxide , suggesting that the actions of op are not mediated through binding to estrogen receptor alpha or beta or by free radical induced damage to steroidogenic enzymes , respectively . these results demonstrate that direct exposure of adult leydig cells to op may have subtle effects on their ability to produce testosterone , which may not be detected by measuring ambient androgen levels . in addition , the effects of op on leydig cell testosterone formation appear to be different from those of the native estrogen , 17beta - estradiol , and from other reported weak xenoestrogens such as endosulfan and bpa .	0
microleakage of class 2 superbond - lined composite restorations with and without a cervical amalgam base .. the purposes of the present study were : 1 ) to assess the microleakage at the cervical margin of superbond - lined composite restorations with and without a cervical amalgam base and compare the results to cervical margins of composite restorations lined with scotchbond 2 , and 2 ) to compare the quality of the occlusal margins of superbond - lined p - 50 restorations with those bonded with scotchbond 2 . forty - eight class 2 cavities were prepared in extracted or exfoliated primary molars . the teeth were randomly divided into three groups and restored as follows : group a , amalgam + superbond + p - 50 ( sandwich ); group b , superbond + p - 50 ; group c , scotchbond 2 + p - 50 ( control ). marginal leakage was assessed by the degree of dye penetration on sections of the restored teeth . the occlusal margins presented no or minimal leakage ( degrees 0 and 1 ) in 53 % of group a restorations , 60 % of group b , and 44 % of group c . these differences were not statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ). the cervical margins showed moderate to severe dye penetration ( degrees 2 and 3 ) in 94 % of group a , 47 % of group b , and 87 % of group c . these differences were statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ). the amalgam / superbond / composite interface exhibited no leakage in 70 % of the restorations . although marginal leakage was not completely eliminated , superbond exhibited significantly less leakage ( p < 0 . 05 ) at the cervical margins than scotchbond 2 or amalgam with superbond .	0
shear bond strength of composite resin to fresh amalgam .. the shear bond strength between fresh amalgam and composite resin using three adhesive systems was assessed . amalgambond ( 5 . 19 mpa ), all - bond ( 3 . 45 mpa ), and clearfil new - bond ( 4 . 37 mpa ) had comparable shear bond strengths higher than enamel bond ( 1 . 27 mpa ) after 48 hours of water immersion . this bond was hydrolytically degraded during 100 days of immersion in water . the greatest deterioration was observed for clearfil new - bond ( 0 . 81 mpa ). amalgambond provided the best results , whereas all - bond and clearfil new - bond had comparable bond strength to enamel bond at the end of the experiment .	0
prenatal and postnatal exposure to bisphenol a induces anxiolytic behaviors and cognitive deficits in mice .. bisphenol a ( bpa ), an environmental endocrine - disrupting chemical , has been extensively evaluated for reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity . however , little is known about the behavioral and neurochemical effects of bpa exposure . this study examined whether chronic daily exposure to an environmental endocrine - disrupting chemical , bisphenol a [( bpa ); 100 microg / kg / day or 500 microg / kg / day , p . o . ], from prenatal day 7 to postnatal day 36 would lead to changes in anxiety and memory in mice . first , we observed the behavioral alterations of bpa - treated mice using two anxiety - related models , the open field test and elevated plus maze ( epm ) test . in the open field test , bpa treatment ( 100 microg / kg / day ) increased movement in the central zone . bpa treatment ( 500 microg / kg / day ) also increased the time spent in the open arms in the epm test . second , we measured cognitive ability in the y - maze test and novel object test . bpa - treated mice showed decreased alternation behavior in the y - maze at both of doses , indicating working memory impairment . bpa - treated mice ( 100 microg / kg / day ) also showed decreased novel object recognition as expressed by central locomotion and frequency in the central zone , showing recognition memory impairment . finally , to measure changes in the dopaminergic and nmdaergic systems in the brain , we performed autoradiographic receptor binding assays for dopamine d ( 1 ) and d ( 2 ) receptors , the nmda receptor , and the dopamine transporter . bpa treatment increased d ( 2 ) receptor binding in the caudate putamen ( cpu ) but decreased dat binding . bpa treatment also decreased nmda receptor binding in the frontal cortex and ca1 , ca3 , and dg of the hippocampus . taken together , our results suggest that long - term bpa exposure in mice can induce anxiolytic behaviors , cognitive deficits and changes in the dopaminergic and nmdaergic systems .	0

placental transfer of conjugated bisphenol a and subsequent reactivation in the rat fetus .. background : bisphenol a ( bpa ), a well - known endocrine disruptor , is highly glucuronidated in the liver , and the resultant bpa - glucuronide ( bpa - ga ) is excreted primarily into bile . however , in rodents , prenatal exposure to low doses of bpa can adversely affect the fetus , despite the efficient drug - metabolizing systems of the dams . the transport mechanisms of bpa from mother to fetus are unknown . objectives : to test our hypothesis that bpa - ga - an inactive metabolite - is passed through the placenta to the fetus , where it affects the fetus after reactivation , we investigated the placental transfer of bpa - ga and reactivation to bpa in the fetus . methods : after performing uterine perfusion with bpa - ga in pregnant rats , we examined the expression and localization of the placental transporters for drug metabolites in the perfusate by reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry . we also investigated the deconjugation of bpa - ga in the fetus and examined uridine 5 - diphospho - glucuronosyltransferase ( ugt ) activity toward bpa and the expression of ugt isoforms in fetal liver . results : we detected bpa - ga and deconjugated bpa in the fetus and amniotic fluid after perfusion . in the trophoblast cells , organic anion - transporting polypeptide 4a1 ( oatp4a1 ) was localized on the apical membrane , and multidrug resistance - associated protein 1 ( mrp1 ) was localized to the basolateral membrane . we observed deconjugation of bpa - ga in the fetus ; furthermore , we found the expression of ugt2b1 , which metabolizes bpa , to be quite low in the fetus . conclusions : these results demonstrate that bpa - ga is transferred into the fetus and deconjugated in the fetus because of its vulnerable drug - metabolizing system .	0
pulp capping materials exert an effect on the secretion of il - 1β and il - 8 by migrating human neutrophils .. pulp repair is a complex process whose mechanisms are not yet fully understood . the first immune cells to reach the damaged pulp are neutrophils that play an important role in releasing cytokines and in phagocytosis . the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of different pulp - capping materials on the secretion of interleukin - 1 beta ( il - 1β ) and interleukin - 8 ( il - 8 ) by migrating human neutrophils . neutrophils were obtained from the blood of three healthy donors . the experimental groups were calcium hydroxide [ ca ( oh )( 2 )], an adhesive system ( single bond ), and mineral trioxide aggregate ( mta ). untreated cells were used as control . transwell chambers were used in performing the assays to mimic an in vivo situation of neutrophil chemotaxis . the pulp - capping materials were placed in the lower chamber and the human neutrophils , in the upper chamber . the cells were counted and the culture medium was assayed using elisa kits for detecting and quantifying il - 1β and il8 . the data were compared by anova followed by tukey ' s test ( p < 0 . 05 ). the secretion of il - 8 was significantly higher in all groups in comparison to the control group ( p < 0 . 05 ). the adhesive system group showed higher il - 8 than the mta group ( p < 0 . 05 ). the secretion of il - 1β was significantly greater only in the mta group ( p < 0 . 001 ). it was concluded that only mta is able to improve the secretion of il - 1β , and all materials tested increased il - 8 secretion . these results combined with all the other biological advantages of mta indicate that it could be considered the material of choice for dental pulp capping .	0
synthesis and characterization of iodinated polyurethane with inherent radiopacity .. the synthesis and characterization of polyurethane ( pu ) with excellent radiopacity for medical and allied applications are reported . bisphenol - a ( bpa ) was iodinated to obtain 4 , 4 '- isopropylidinedi -( 2 , 6 - diiodophenol ) ( ibpa ) which was used as a chain extender for the preparation of a radiopaque pu . the pu was prepared by reacting 4 , 4 '- methylenebis ( phenyl isocyanate ) ( mdi ), poly ( tetramethylene glycol ) ( ptmg ) and ibpa in 2 . 2 : 1 . 2 : 1 molecular ratio and is characterized by infrared spectroscopy ( ir ), thermogravimetry ( tga ), dynamic mechanical analysis ( dma ), energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edx ), gel permeation chromatography ( gpc ) and x - radiography . x - ray images showed that the pu prepared using ibpa as the chain extender is highly radiopaque . an in vitro cytotoxicity test using l929 mouse fibroblast cells shows that the pu is non - cytotoxic . the outlined synthesis of a pu with radiocontrast properties opens up the possibility of synthesizing many different kinds of radiopaque pus with desirable range of physical properties exploiting the versatility in their chemical synthesis .	0
capping the inflamed pulp under different clinical conditions .. background : a great deal of controversy exists regarding the reliability of capping the inflamed pulp . in particular , the use of calcium hydroxide as a capping agent has come into question . in this study , hard tissue barrier formation after inflamed pulps were capped directly or after partial pulpotomy was compared with calcium hydroxide or bonded resin and with no additional seal or an irm surface seal . seventy teeth in five dogs were used . ten untreated teeth were used as negative controls . in 60 teeth , pulpal inflammation was induced by preparing a cavity close to the pulp and sealing a cotton pellet soaked in plaque in it for 1 to 2 weeks . the cavities were then re - entered and extended to expose the pulps . materials and methods : in half the teeth ( n = 30 ) a partial pulpotomy was performed and in the other half ( n = 30 ) pulpal treatment was performed on the superficial exposed pulp . both pulpal treatment groups received the same restorative procedures : ( 1 ) calcium hydroxide + amalgam + irm surface seal ; ( 2 ) optibond solo , prodigy with irm surface seal ; or ( 3 ) optibond solo , prodigy without irm surface seal . the presence , absence , and quality of a hard tissue barrier were evaluated histologically . results : the calcium hydroxide groups were statistically superior to all other groups . the irm surface seal resulted in significantly better healing . although there was no statistically significant difference between direct pulp capping and partial pulpotomy with the numbers in this study , power statistics indicated that in clinical practice a partial pulpotomy would be preferable . clinical significance the results of this study suggest that a partial pulpotomy , calcium hydroxide medicament , and a bacteria - tight coronal restoration represent a viable technique for capping the inflamed pulp .	0
"""impact of adhesive application to wet and dry dentin on long - term resin - dentin bond strengths .. this study compared the effects of moisture and rubbing action on the immediate and one - year microtensile bond strength ( bs ) of an ethanol / water - based adhesive system ( single bond [ sb ]) and an acetone - based system ( one step [ os ]) to dentin . a flat superficial dentin surface on 60 human molars was exposed by wet abrasion . two coats of the adhesives were applied on either a dry ( d ) or rewetted surface ( w ) with no ( nra ), slight ( sra ) or vigorous rubbing action ( vra ). after light curing ( 600 mw / cm2 / 10 seconds ), composite buildups were constructed incrementally and the specimens were stored in water ( 37 degrees c / 24 hours ). they were longitudinally sectioned in the """" x """" and """" y """" directions to obtain bonded sticks ( 0 . 8 mm2 ) to be tested in tension at 0 . 5 mm / minute . the sticks from each tooth were then divided , stored in water at 37 degrees c and tested immediately and after 12 months ( 12 m ) at 0 . 5 mm / minute . the bond strength values of sticks from the same hemitooth were averaged for statistical purposes . the prematurely debonded specimens were included in the hemi - tooth mean . the data from each adhesive was analyzed by three - way anova and tukey ' s multiple comparison tests ( alpha = 0 . 05 ). in the dry groups , high bond strength values were obtained under vra . when the dentin was kept moist , both sra and vra provided high resin - dentin bond strength values . reductions in bond strength values after one year of water storage were not observed for the sb adhesive or were less pronounced for the os adhesive when it was vigorously rubbed onto the dentin surface ."""	0
effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( pbdes ) and their derivatives on protein disulfide isomerase activity and growth hormone release of gh3 cells .. polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( pbdes ) have been used in a variety of consumer products such as flame retardants and recently have been known to be widespread environmental pollutants , which probably affect biological functions of mammalian cells . however , the risk posed by pbde metabolites has not been clarified . our previous study suggested that bisphenol a ( bpa ), an endocrine - disrupting chemical , binds to protein disulfide isomerase ( pdi ) and inhibits its activity . pdi is an isomerase enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitates the formation or cleavage of disulfide bonds . pdi consists of a , b , b ', and a ' domains and the c region , with the a and a ' domains having isomerase active sites . in the present study , we tested the effects of 10 kinds of pbde compounds and their metabolites on pdi . oh - pbdes specifically inhibited the isomerase activity of pdi , with 4 '- oh - pbde more effective than 2 ' ( or 2 )- oh - pbdes . 4 '- oh - pbde inhibited the isomerase activity of the b ' a ' c fragment but not that of ab and a ' c , suggesting that the b ' domain of pdi is essential for the inhibition by 4 '- oh - pbde . we also investigated the effects of these chemicals on the production of growth hormone ( gh ) in gh3 cells . in gh3 cells , levels of mrna and protein of gh stimulated by t ( 3 ) were reduced by 4 '- oh - pbde and 4 '- meo - pbde . the reduction in gh expression caused by these compounds was not changed by the overexpression or knockdown of pdi in gh3 cells , while these manipulations of pdi levels significantly suppressed the expression of gh . these results suggest that the biological effects of pbdes differed depending on their brominated and hydroxylated positions .	0
sorption of bisphenol a , 17α - ethinyl estradiol and phenanthrene on thermally and hydrothermally produced biochars .. thermal and hydrothermal biochars were characterized , and adsorption of bisphenol a ( bpa ), 17α - ethinyl estradiol ( ee2 ) and phenanthrene ( phen ) was determined to investigate the sorption characteristic difference between the two types of biochars . thermal biochars were composed mostly of aromatic moieties , with low h / c and o / c ratios as compared to hydrothermal ones having diverse functional groups . single - point organic carbon - normalized distribution coefficients ( logk ( oc )) of ee2 and bpa of hydrothermal biochars were higher than thermal biochars , while phen logk ( oc ) values were comparable among them . x - ray diffraction and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance results suggested that hydrothermal biochars consisted of more amorphous aliphatic - c , possibly being responsible for their high sorption capacity of phen . this study demonstrated that hydrothermal biochars could adsorb a wider spectrum of both polar and nonpolar organic contaminants than thermally produced biochars , suggesting that hydrothermal biochar derived from poultry and animal waste is a potential sorbent for agricultural and environmental applications .	0
in vitro wear simulation measurements of composite versus resin - modified glass ionomer luting cements for all - ceramic restorations .. background : although composite cements are generally indicated for cementation of all - ceramic restorations , some manufacturers of dental cements propose that resin - modified glass ionomers ( rmgis ) may be used for cementation of high - strength ceramic restorations . purpose : this study was undertaken to compare the in vitro abrasion and attrition wear of two dual - cure cements ( in dual - cure and self - cure modes ) and two rmgi cements when placed between ceramic and enamel to simulate the margin of a restoration . methods : rectangular fragments of pressed ceramic ( empress 2 ) were cemented between the halves of bovine incisors sectioned mesiodistally , using one of the following materials : relyx arc , variolink ii , relyx luting , or protec cem . the two resin cements were tested in dual - cure and self - cure modes . a three - body wear test was performed in the new oregon health sciences university ( ohsu ) oral wear simulator ( 100 , 000 cycles ; abrasion load : 20 n ; attrition load : 90 n ). degree of conversion of resin cements was determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy . results were analyzed by analysis of variance and tukey ' s test ( p = . 05 ). epoxy replicas of wear specimens were observed in the scanning electron microscope . results : no significant differences in abrasion wear ( relyx arc dual - cure : 11 +/- 4 . 4 microm ; relyx arc self - cure : 17 +/- 7 . 0 microm ; variolink dual - cure : 14 +/- 8 . 6 microm ; variolink self - cure : 23 +/- 10 . 7 microm ) or attrition wear ( relyx arc dual - cure : 18 +/- 6 . 4 microm ; relyx arc self - cure : 31 +/- 4 . 5 microm ; variolink dual - cure : 32 +/- 6 . 8 microm ; variolink self - cure : 39 +/- 15 . 9 microm ) were found between activation modes of the resin cements . protec cem ( 32 +/- 8 . 7 microm ) showed abrasion similar to that of variolink ii and relyx arc self - cure . resin - modified glass ionomers showed more attrition wear than the resin cements ( protec cem : 62 +/- 13 . 0 microm ; relyx luting : 69 +/- 7 . 1 microm ). relyx arc showed a similar degree of conversion for both activation modes ( dual - cure : 70 +/- 4 . 3 %; self - cure : 68 +/- 1 . 2 %), but variolink ii had a higher degree of conversion in dual - cure mode ( 67 +/- 0 . 5 % vs 60 +/- 1 . 0 %). cement wear was accompanied by marginal breakdown and increased surface roughness of enamel and ceramic . conclusions : the activation mode of resin cements did not influence their wear resistance . the rmgis underwent higher attrition wear than the resin cements . clinical significance : increased submargination associated with marginal breakdown and increased roughness of the surrounding structures may be expected when ceramic inlays are cemented with resin - modified glass ionomers .	0
[ degradation of bpa in aqueous solution by interaction of photocatalytic oxidation and ferrate ( vi ) oxidation ].. the degradation of bispehnol a ( bpa ) in aqueous suspension by interaction of photocatalytic oxidation and ferrate ( vi ) oxidation was investigated under different conditions . the results indicate that the formation of fe ( v ) and fe ( iv ) is in the photoreduction of fe ( vi ) by electron ( e ( cb )-) on the surface of tio2 . the oxidation efficiency of the photocatalytic oxidation in the presence of fe ( vi ) is much greater than that without fe ( vi ). in addition , the decomposition of fe ( vi ) under different conditions was also investigated . the results indicate that the fe ( vi ) reduction is enhanced by photocatalytic oxidation and the adsorption capacity of fe ( vi ) at tio2 surface decreases with ph increase . when the photocatalytic oxidation is used to degrade bpa , fe ( vi ) could increase the degradation rate about 2 . 5 times .	0
uptake , metabolism and excretion of bisphenol a in the rainbow trout ( oncorhynchus mykiss ).. the uptake , metabolism and excretion of the oestrogenic chemical bisphenol a ( bpa ) were studied in juvenile rainbow trout ( oncorhynchus mykiss ). bpa was detectable in plasma , liver and muscle after 2 h of water exposure at 0 . 44 microm ( 100 microg bpa / l ), and a steady state was reached within 12 - 24 h . the concentration of the glucuronidated degradation product in the plasma was about twice that of the parent compound . a plasma half life of bpa was calculated as 3 . 75 h following injection of the compound . the vitellogenin synthesis was measured in response to the bpa treatment , and a lag period of 5 and 7 days between injection of the compound and a significant vitellogenin response was observed for females and males , respectively . at the time of the vitellogenin response no bpa could be detected in the liver tissue from either male or female fish . these results indicate that fish briefly exposed to elevated levels of oestrogenic chemicals might develop a response several days later .	0
chronic exposure to 17 alpha - ethinylestradiol and bisphenol a - effects on development and reproduction in the freshwater invertebrate chironomus riparius ( diptera : chironomidae ).. the effect of 17 alpha - ethinylestradiol ( ee ) and bisphenol a ( bpa ) on development and reproduction in chironomus riparius was determined over two generations in chronic sediment exposure assays . a number of response criteria were examined in order to identify any chemical - related effects including median emergence times ( emt50 ), the number and sex ratio of emerged adults , egg production and egg viability . the results showed that emergence time and percentage adult emergence were affected by ee and bpa exposure . these effects were primarily associated with the second generation of test animals , most notably in the bpa study , where the emergence of male and female adults was significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) delayed at concentrations ranging from 78 ng / l to 0 . 75 mg / l . at very low concentrations ( 1 ng / l ) of ee , both the first and second generation of adults emerged significantly earlier than control animals . no effect on the percentage emergence of first generation adults was evident with either chemical or in the second generation with bpa . the number of egg - ropes produced by the first generation females varied between treatments but no dose - response pattern was evident . although certain responses were significantly affected , results in general do not suggest that the criteria examined , although validated as indicators of general sediment toxicity , could be used to detect the oestrogenic effects of ee and bpa on c . riparius .	0
[ estrogenic activity of some environmental chemicals ].. the study was designed to explore the estrogenic activity of environmental disrupters [ n - 4 - noniphenol ( np ), bisphenol a ( bisa ) and dibutylphthalate ( dbp )]. estrogen - respective breast cancer cell line t47d was grown in dmem medium containing 10 % bovine serum . five days before the addition of the test compounds , the cell were washed in phosphate - buffered saline , and the medium was substituted with a phenol red - free dmem medium containing 5 % dextran charcoal - stripped fbs . the respective test compound was added in fresh medium and the control cell received only the vehicle ( ethanol ). the proliferation of t47d cells was analyzed by mtt assay , 3h - tdr incorporation assay and flow sytometer . the results indicated that , compared with the etoh control cell , the test compounds ( n - 4 - noniphenol , bisphenol a and dibutylphthalate ), like estradiol , markedly enhanced the proliferation of t47d cell and the metaphase of cell division , and the results showed time - dependent and dose - dependent model . these data showed that the tested chemicals could enhance the proliferation of human cervix cancer cell in vitro . this might hinted that these chemicals possessed estrogenic activity and they might play their estrogen through estrogenic receptor .	0
numerical simulation of organic chemicals in a marine environment using a coupled 3d hydrodynamic and ecotoxicological model .. for ecotoxicological risk assessment in a marine ecosystem , we constructed a coupled three - dimensional hydrodynamic and ecotoxicological model ( emt - 3d ), and applied it to tokyo bay . the model was calibrated with field data obtained in 2002 . the results of sensitivity analysis for dissolved bisphenol a showed that biodegradation rate was the most important factor for concentration change . bioconcentration coefficient was the most important factor for bisphenol a in phytoplankton . therefore , the parameters must be carefully considered in the modeling . the mass balance results showed that standing stocks of bisphenol a in water , in particulate organic carbon and in phytoplankton are 7 . 85 x 10 ( 4 ), 1 . 78 x 10 ( 2 ) and 3 . 44 x 10 (- 1 ) g , respectively . with respect to flux , biodegradation in the water column had the highest value of 1 . 06 x 10 ( 3 ) g / day , and next were effluent to the open sea , partition to particulate organic carbon , and bioconcentration in phytoplankton .	0
directed polymerization shrinkage versus a horizontal incremental filling technique : interfacial adaptation in vivo in class ii cavities .. purpose : ( 1 ) to evaluate the interfacial adaptation to dentin and enamel of class ii composite resin restorations placed in vivo with the directed shrinkage technique , a combination of a self - curing ( bisfil 2b ) and a light - curing composite resin ( aelitefil ); ( 2 ) to compare this technique with a horizontal incremental filling technique , where the gingival layer of the light - curing composite resin was cured with a transparent light - tip ; ( 3 ) to evaluate the effect of a hydrophilic bonding system ( all - bond 2 ) on the marginal adaptation of both application techniques . materials and methods : in each of 34 premolars , scheduled to be extracted for orthodontic reasons , a mesial and a distal cavity was restored with composite resin filling material using the directed shrinkage technique ( bisfil 2b / aelitefil ) and a horizontal incremental filling technique ( aelitefil ). in six groups , a hydrophilic dentin bonding system ( all - bond 2 ) was applied . as control , an enamel bonding agent ( gluma 4 ) was used in one of the directed shrinkage and in one of the horizontal incremental filling groups . for conditioning of the cavities a 10 % phosphoric acid gel was used in six groups and a 32 % acid gel in the other two groups . the teeth were extracted after 1 month , sectioned and replicas of the sections were made . quality of the interfacial adaptation was studied with a scanning electron microscope . results : on the pairwise comparisons between the two application groups , no significant differences were found between the directed shrinkage technique and the horizontal incremental filling technique . the groups using the hydrophilic bonding system showed a significant better adaptation , with gap - free attachment in 77 %- 87 % of the length of the dentin margins investigated . no significant differences for adaptation to enamel were seen between the investigated groups . the adhesive failures were found mostly between the hybrid layer and the composite resin , while the dentin was still sealed . no significant difference in interfacial quality was seen between the cavities using the 10 % or the 32 % phosphoric acid conditioning . a relative high frequency of enamel fractures , parallel to the interfaces , was found in the 10 % phosphoric acid - conditioned cavities , especially in the cervical enamel interfaces .	0
augmented pin fixation with cortoss for an unstable ao - a3 type distal radius fracture in a patient with a manifest osteoporosis .. distal radius fractures are one of the most common fractures in the elderly females . in this article , we report a case of a distal radius fracture type ao - a3 with dorsal instability , in an older woman with manifest osteoporosis , treated with minimally invasive cortoss composite and ffs - wires ( r ). a 63 - year - old woman sustained an unstable distal radial fracture of her left wrist after falling from a kitchen step . she underwent an open reduction of the fracture and fixation with two crossed - fixation pins and cortoss composite . post - operative plaster cast immobilization was given for 2 weeks , after which the plaster cast and the fixation pins were removed . at 4 weeks follow - up , she had a good functional result of her left wrist , after 11 months there was a complete return of grip strength with also , except for the palmar flexion , a full return of function . we report here the first case of a successful surgical treatment with cortoss composite of an ao - a3 type distal radius fracture .	0
a mutation in a cuticle collagen causes hypersensitivity to the endocrine disrupting chemical , bisphenol a , in caenorhabditis elegans .. a novel mutant gene , bis - 1 ( bisphenol a sensitive ) has been isolated in the nematode , caenorhabditis elegans , that affects the response to endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edc ). the bis - 1 ( nx3 ) allele is hypersensitive to bisphenol a ( bpa ), is allelic to a collagen gene ( col - 121 ), and is expressed in hypodermal cells . among the collagen mutants so far studied , bis - 1 ( nx3 ), dpy - 2 ( e8 ), dpy - 7 ( e88 ) and dpy - 10 ( e128 ) showed bpa sensitivity . the isolated mutant may work as a useful tool for the assay of edc toxicity since the physiological effect of the collagen mutation ( glycine substitution ) indicates an increased sensitivity to bpa .	0
low doses of the endocrine disruptor bisphenol - a and the native hormone 17beta - estradiol rapidly activate transcription factor creb .. endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) are hormone - like agents present in the environment that alter the endocrine system of wildlife and humans . most edcs have potencies far below those of the natural hormone 17beta - e2 when acting through the classic estrogen receptors ( ers ). here , we show that the environmental estrogen bisphenol - a and the native hormone 17beta - e2 activate the transcription factor , camp - responsive element binding protein ( creb ) with the same potency . phosphorylated creb ( p - creb ) was increased after only a 5 - minute application of either bpa or 17beta - e2 in a calcium - dependent manner . the effect was reproduced by the membrane - impermeable molecule e2 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( e - hrp ). the increase in p - creb was not modified by the anti - estrogen ici 182 , 780 . therefore , low - dose of bpa activates the transcription factor creb via an alternative mechanism , involving a non - classical membrane estrogen receptor . because these effects are elicited at concentrations as low as 10 (- 9 ) m , this observation is of environmental and public health relevance .	0
cytotoxic effects of acrylates and methacrylates : relationships of monomer structures and cytotoxicity .. thirty - nine acrylates and methacrylates that had been used in dental resin materials were evaluated by a cytotoxicity test , and the relationships between their structures and cytotoxicity were studied to predict cytotoxic levels of dental resin materials in order to develop new low - toxic resin materials . all the acrylates evaluated were more toxic than corresponding methacrylates . in both the acrylates and methacrylates , a hydroxyl group seemed to enhance cytotoxicity . dimethacrylates with 14 or fewer oxyethylene chains showed similar cytotoxicity while dimethacrylates with 23 oxyethylene chains showed lower cytotoxicity . the cytotoxicity ranking of monomers widely used in dental resin materials was bisphenol a bis 2 - hydroxypropyl methacrylate ( bisgma ) > urethane dimethacrylate ( udma ) > triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate ( 3g ) > 2 - hydroxyethyl methacrylate ( hema ) > methyl methacrylate ( mma ). in acrylates , methacrylates , and ethylmethacrylates with either substituents , the lipophilicity of substituents affected their cytotoxicity , and an inverse correlation between ic50 and logp was observed . these results will be useful in developing new resin materials with low toxic monomer compositions .	0
effect of a re - wetting agent on the performance of acetone - based dentin adhesives .. purpose : to compare the in vitro bond strengths of two acetone - based one - bottle dentin adhesives applied to four surface moisture conditions . the tested hypothesis was that wetting a dried dentin surface with an aqueous hema solution would result in bond strengths similar or higher than those obtained by leaving the surface moist as per manufacturers ' instructions . materials and methods : eighty flat dentin bonding sites were polished to 600 - grit on middle dentin of the labial surface of bovine incisors mounted in acrylic resin . the specimens were equally and randomly divided between two acetone - based dentin adhesives ( one - step and prime & bond 2 . 1 ) and four different levels of surface moisture ( moist dentin , dentin dried for 1 s , dentin dried for 5 s , and dentin dried for 5 s followed by re - wetting with aqua - prep , an aqueous hema solution ). a composite post was then adapted to the treated area and light - cured . after thermocycling , the bond strengths were determined by testing the specimens in shear . field emission sem examinations were carried out to evaluate the effects of different treatments on the dentin - resin interface . results : statistical analysis revealed that the application of one - step resulted in similar mean shear bond strengths for the groups in which moisture was present on the dentin surface ( 12 . 0 - 14 . 2 mpa ). the mean shear bond strengths for the group in which one - step was applied to a dried dentin surface was significantly lower ( 6 . 0 mpa ). for prime & bond 2 . 1 , the application of a re - wetting solution significantly increased mean shear bond strengths ( 13 . 9 mpa ). the remaining three prime & bond 2 . 1 groups yielded statistically similar mean bond strengths , regardless of the surface condition ( 6 . 6 - 8 . 1 mpa ).	0
reproductive function in rats exposed neonatally to bisphenol a and estradiol benzoate .. the reproductive function in rats treated subcutaneously ( s . c .) with 300 microg / g bisphenol a or 2 microg / g estradiol benzoate from postnatal day 1 to 5 was examined after puberty as well as histolopathogic changes in reproductive organs . all male and female rats treated postnatally with estradiol benzoate showed poor reproductive capability , including adverse effects on masculine sexual behavior , and marked histopathologic alterations of the reproductive organs . in addition , estradiol benzoate markedly reduced the volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area ( sdn - poa ) in males . on the other hand , all male and female rats treated postnatally with bisphenol a showed normal reproductive function and no histopathologic abnormalities of reproductive organs . bisphenol a did not affect the volume of the sdn - poa . these results indicated that neonatal exposure to estradiol benzoate affects reproductive function in male and female rats , and treatment with bisphenol a at a fairly high dose was ineffective if given postnatally to male and female rats .	0
concomitant degradation of bisphenol a during ultrasonication and fenton oxidation and production of biofertilizer from wastewater sludge .. degradation of bisphenol a ( bpa ), an endocrine disruptor , from wastewater sludge ( wws ) has attracted great interest recently . in the present study , the effects of different pre - treatment methods , including ultrasonication ( us ), fenton ' s oxidation ( fo ) and ferro - sonication ( fs ) was assessed in terms of increase in solubilization of wws and simultaneous degradation of bpa . among us , fo and fs pre - treatment , higher suspended solids ( ss ), volatile suspended solids ( vss ), chemical oxygen demand ( cod ) and soluble organic carbon ( soc ) solubilization ( 39 . 7 %, 51 . 2 %, 64 . 5 % and 17 . 6 %, respectively ) was observed during a ferro - sonication pre - treatment process carried out for 180 min , resulting in higher degradation of bpa ( 82 . 7 %). in addition , the effect of rheological parameters ( viscosity and particle size ) and zeta potential on the degradation of bpa in raw and different pre - treated sludges were also investigated . the results showed that a decrease in viscosity and particle size and an increase in zeta potential resulted in higher degradation of bpa . bpa degradation by laccases produced by sinorhizobium meliloti in raw and pre - treated sludge was also determined . higher activity of laccases ( 207 . 9 u l (- 1 )) was observed in ferro - sonicated pre - treated sludge ( 180 min ultrasonic time ), resulting in higher removal of bpa ( 0 . 083 μg g (- 1 )), suggesting concomitant biological degradation of bpa .	0
development and validation of a gc - ms method for the evaluation of 17 endocrine disruptor compounds , including phytoestrogens and sitosterol , in coastal waters - their spatial and seasonal levels in porto costal region ( portugal ).. a gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection ( gc - ms ) method was developed and optimized for the determination of 17 endocrine disrupting compounds ( edcs ) in coastal water samples . the evaluated edcs were from different origins and included estrogens , bisphenol a , alkylphenolethoxylates , alkylphenols , phytoestrogens and sitosterol ( sito ). the edcs were extracted from samples using oasis hlb ( hydrophilic - lipophilic balance ) cartridges and derivatized with n , o - bis ( trimethylsilyl ) trifluoroacetamide ( bstfa ) added with 1 % trimethylchlorosilane ( tmcs ). the validation parameters revealed that this method was highly specific for all assayed compounds (> 99 %) and the linearity of the calibration curves showed a correlation higher than 0 . 99 . the detection limits were at low ng / l level and the recovery rates were higher than 70 %. the performance of the method was checked using coastal water samples taken every 2 months during 2009 - 2010 from the douro river estuary and the porto coastline ( portugal ). these data revealed that approximately 98 . 0 % of the analyzed compounds showed levels above their limits of detection ( lods ). the measured estrogens ( 2 - 20 ng / l ) and industrial pollutants ( up to 1 . 1 μg / l ) were in biologic hazardous concentrations . besides , a clear seasonal pattern of fluctuation was established for phytoestrogens and sito . the physicochemical data , namely the amounts of nitrates , nitrites and phosphorous , confirmed the low water quality of this area .	0

retention and marginal adaptation of a compomer placed in non - stress - bearing areas used with the total - etch technique : a 3 - year retrospective study .. the aim of this clinical study was to evaluate class v and class iii cavities restored with a polyacid - modified resin composite ( compomer ) restorative material in association with two different dentin - enamel bonding systems : dyract - psa ( primer sealer adhesive - dentsply , germany ) and prime & bond 2 . 0 ( dentsply , germany ). the control group was a hybrid composite used with probond bonding system ( dentsply , germany ). a total of 116 restorations ( 79 class v , 37 class iii ) were made and reevaluated after 1 , 2 and 3 years in 55 patients in two private practices and in a university department . class v nonretentive cavities were located at the cej level and class iii at interproximal level close to cej . each cavity was prepared using a water - cooled , high - speed handpiece with a fine diamond burr . a small bevel was prepared along enamel margin . cavity dimensions were no more than 3 . 5 x 3 . 5 mm ( using burr as reference point ). each restoration was finished immediately with fine diamond burrs and sof - lex disks ( 3 m , usa ). the criteria that were evaluated by the usphs method included : retention , color match , marginal integrity , marginal discoloration , and secondary caries . results indicated that all compomer restorations were fully retained at 3 years , and that no secondary caries detected . seven composite restorations were lost during the 3 - year study . no statistical differences were observed between class iii and class v or among other conditions ( e . g ., upper - lower arc , sex , age ). this study demonstrates that compomers are suitable restorative materials for class iii - v restorations . they may represent a clinical alternative to composites in class v and iii restorations .	0
using extracted teeth for research : the effect of storage medium and sterilization on dentin bond strengths .. background : the centers for disease control and prevention has adopted guidelines for infection control of extracted teeth used for research and teaching , requiring that teeth be sterilized before use . the authors conducted a study to test the null hypothesis that the storage medium and sterilization method have no effect on composite - to - dentin bond strengths . materials and methods : the authors collected 170 bovine incisors , cleaned them and placed them randomly into one of six storage media at 37 degrees c for 60 days : distilled water ( dh ( 2 ) o ), 0 . 9 percent sodium chloride , 0 . 5 percent chloramine - t , 5 . 25 percent sodium hypochlorite ( naclo ), 2 percent glutaraldehyde and 10 percent formalin . for sterilization , they autoclaved a subset of 10 specimens from every sample , while they stored another subset of 10 specimens from every sample ( except for the 10 percent formalin sample ) in 10 percent formalin for 14 days . the authors then embedded the specimens in epoxy and ground flat the facial surface to expose middle - depth dentin , which they polished to 600 grit . they used a dental adhesive to apply composite to the exposed dentin . the authors tested the composite - to - dentin shear bond strength 24 hours after bonding . they analyzed the data using global analysis of variance and , when appropriate , multiple post hoc tests ( p = . 05 ). results : storage in naclo resulted in significantly lower bond strength than that of the other treatment specimens . sterilization with the autoclave negatively affected the bond strength of specimens stored initially in dh ( 2 ) o or 10 percent formalin , while sterilization with formalin alone had no significant effect on bond strengths . conclusions : storing bovine teeth in 5 . 25 percent naclo may negatively affect composite - to - dentin bond strengths . immersion in 10 percent formalin might be the best option for storage and sterilization of bovine teeth that are to be used in dental bonding studies in vitro .	0
bond strength performance of different resin composites used as core materials around fiber posts .. objectives : to evaluate the microtensile bond strengths of different resin composites used as core materials around fiber posts . methods : forty dt light - posts ( rtd ) were randomly divided into eight groups , according to the resin composite used . they included two core materials specifically developed for core build - up -- group 1 : core - flo ( bisco inc .) and group 2 : unifil core ( gc corp .); three hybrid composites -- group 3 : tetric ceram ( ivoclar - vivadent ), group 4 : gradia direct ( gc corp .), group 5 : bisfil 2b ( bisco , inc .); and three flowable composites -- group 6 : aeliteflo ( bisco , inc .), group 7 : filtek flow ( 3m espe ) and group 8 : unifil flow ( gc corp ). a cylindrical plastic matrix was placed around the silanized post and filled with the respective resin composite . each bonded post provided five to eight sticks for microtensile testing . each stick was loaded to failure under tension at a cross - head speed of 0 . 5mm / min . one - way anova and tukey ' s test were used for statistical analysis . scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) was used to evaluate the interface of the fractured sticks . results : resin composites exhibited a significant influence on microtensile bond strength ( p < 0 . 05 ). core - flo showed the highest bond strength ( 11 . 00 +/- 0 . 69 mpa ) although it was not statistically significantly different from all groups , except from the flowable composites . under sem , all the composites adapted well to the fiber post , with a variable extent of voids observed along the fractured composite interfaces . significance : although good adaptation to the post surface was achieved , bond strength to fiber post remains relatively weak . core build - up and hybrid composites are better alternatives to flowable composites as core build - up materials .	0
micro - tensile bond strength to surface and subsurface enamel .. unlabelled : testing of bond strength to enamel has been undertaken on both surface and subsurface enamel on the assumption that it is the same substrate . over recent years , the micro - tensile method has become widely used for the evaluation of dental adhesives . however , there have been no micro - tensile bond strength studies comparing surface and subsurface enamel using orthodontic adhesives . it has been proposed that the bond strength to subsurface enamel is greater than that to surface enamel . objective : the micro - tensile bond strength ( mtbs ) of transbond ( light activated paste , 3 m unitek , usa ) to surface and subsurface enamel was investigated . methods : ten sound freshly extracted lower human first molars were divided into two groups of five each . surface enamel of the first group was removed with 500 - grit silicone carbide paper , whilst in the second group it was left intact . gelatin capsules filled with transbond composite paste were bonded perpendicular to the enamel using light cure adhesive primer ( transbond xt , 3 m unitek , usa ) in both groups , and stored in distilled water at 37 degrees c for 24 h . crowns of all specimens were sectioned bucco - lingually into vertical slabs of approximately 0 . 6 mm thickness . slabs in each group were prepared into an hourglass shape of 1mm width and 0 . 6 mm thickness . micro - tensile bond strength was determined using a mini tensile testing machine ( compact gauge , dillon ). results : mean values of mtbs were : 31 . 2 mpa ( sd14 . 5 ) for surface enamel and 47 . 9 ( sd15 . 0 ) for subsurface enamel . significance : there was a significant difference between the two groups p = 0 . 001 . it was concluded that subsurface enamel has significantly higher bond strength than surface enamel . this has implications for bonding in restorative dentistry and orthodontics .	0
modulation by estrogens and xenoestrogens of recombinant human neuronal nicotinic receptors .. the effects of estrogens and xenoestrogens on human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor / channels were examined by expressing recombinant channels in xenopus oocytes . when functional channels were expressed with alpha3 and beta4 subunits , estrogens ( 17beta - estradiol , 17alpha - estradiol , 17alpha - ethynylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol ) and xenoestrogens ( bisphenol a , p - nonylphenol and p - octylphenol ) inhibited an ionic current activated by acetylcholine at concentrations up to 100 microm . when the subunit combination was changed to alpha4beta2 , diethystilbestrol and the xenoestrogens inhibited the acetylcholine - activated current , but 17beta - estradiol or 17alpha - estradiol did not . for 17alpha - ethynylestradiol , the current through the alpha4beta2 receptor / channel was inhibited at 1 microm , but it was markedly enhanced at 10 and 100 microm . tamoxifen ( 10 microm ), an antiestrogen , itself inhibited the acetylcholine - activated current but did not antagonize the current modulations induced by the estrogens and the xenoestrogens . these and additional results suggest that human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are the targets of non - genomic actions of estrogens and xenoestrogens .	0
allergic contact dermatitis from non - diglycidyl - ether - of - bisphenol - a epoxy resins .. in addition to previously presented patients with allergic contact dermatitis from cycloaliphatic epoxy resins ( ers ), during 1974 - 1990 , we have seen 4 patients with allergic contact dermatitis ( acd ) caused by products containing uncured non - diglycidyl - ether - of - bisphenol - a er . the patients were negative on patch testing with the standard er based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol a ( dgeba - er ). the following non - dgeba - ers were included in the causative agents : heterocyclic dimethylhydantoin er , phenol novolak er , and brominated er . we were unable to specify the type of er in an epoxy primer used by the 4th patient . apart from the acd caused by the brominated er , 1 of the patients also had ige - mediated occupational rhinitis caused by methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride ( mhhpa ), an epoxy hardener . the diagnosis was verified by positive prick tests and specific ige determinations with mhhpa . intense rhinitis evoked by a bronchial challenge with mhhpa confirmed the diagnosis . we stress the importance of performing patch testing with the relevant epoxy resins to which the patient has been exposed , in addition to patch testing with the standard er .	0

"""one - year clinical evaluation of composite fillings and inlays in posterior teeth .. in the course of a prospectively designed long - term clinical trial , composite fillings and inlays were evaluated for clinical acceptability as restorative materials in one , two or more surface cavities of posterior teeth over a 1 - year period . in 45 patients , 88 restorations were placed by nine student operators , under the supervision of an experienced dentist , to compare the two half sides using the composite resins tetric ( vivadent ), blend - a - lux ( blend - a - med ), and pertac - hybrid unifil ( espe ). the first clinical follow - up check took place within a time period of 11 - 13 months after placement of the restorations using modified usphs criteria . the interpretation of the clinical criteria showed satisfactory results over this time period : more than 85 % of the inlays and direct fillings were rated """" alpha """" or """" bravo """", using the parameters of assessment defined in this study . only three restorations ( two fillings , one inlay ), all in molars , were rated """" delta """", i . e ., unacceptable . the reasons for their replacement were marginal opening , secondary caries , and loss of sensitivity . for the criteria """" surface texture """", """" anatomical form of the surface """", and """" occlusion """", composite inlays were significantly better than composite fillings . these results indicate that posterior composite restorations provide acceptable and excellent clinical service , even if they are placed by relatively inexperienced student operators ."""	0
direct bone formation on alumina bead composite .. we have developed a composite ( designated abc ), consisting of alumina bead powder as an inorganic filler and bisphenol - alpha - glycidyl methacrylate ( bis - gma )- based resin as an organic matrix , which allows direct bone formation on its surface in vivo . alumina bead powder was manufactured by fusing crushed alpha - alumina powder and quenching it . the beads took spherical form 3 microns in average size . according to powder x - ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , the alumina bead powder was composed of amorphous and delta - crystal phases of alumina in its main crystal structure . fused - quenched silica glass - filled composite ( sgc ) was used as a control . the proportion of filler added to the composites was 70 % w / w . mechanical testing of the abc indicated that it would be strong enough for use under weight - bearing conditions . no apatite formation was detected on the surfaces of either composite after soaking in simulated body fluid for 28 days in vitro . histological examination of rat tibiae for up to 8 weeks revealed that abc bonded to bone directly via a layer of calcium , phosphorus , and alumina with no interposed soft - tissue layer . moreover , the amount of bone directly apposed to the abc surface increased with time , whereas with sgc there was poor direct bone formation even at 8 weeks . the precise mechanism of direct bone formation on abc is as yet unknown but it is possible that changes in the crystallinity of alumina , which is known to be highly biocompatible , contribute to its excellent osteoconductivity in vivo . although bioactive materials such as bioglass or apatite and wollastonite - containing glass - ceramic have previously been reported to form bone - like apatite on their surfaces under acellular conditions via simple chemical reactions , abc does not have such characteristics , and presenting favorable conditions for osteoconduction and tissue calcification may lead to direct bone formation on its surface in vivo .	0
the naringenin - induced proapoptotic effect in breast cancer cell lines holds out against a high bisphenol a background .. fruit and vegetable consumption has generally been associated with the prevention or suppression of cancer . however , food could contain a multitude of chemicals ( e . g ., bisphenol a ; bpa ) that could synergize or antagonize the effects of diet - derived compounds . remarkably , food containers ( e . g ., water and infant bottles ) are the largest source of exposure to bpa for human beings . here , the effects of the coexposure of naringenin ( nar , 1 . 0 × 10 (- 9 ) m to 1 . 0 × 10 (- 4 ) m ) and bpa ( 1 . 0 × 10 (- 5 ) m ) in estrogen - dependent breast cancer cell lines expressing ( i . e ., mcf - 7 and t47d ) or not expressing ( i . e ., mda - mb - 231 ) estrogen receptor α ( erα ) are reported . although both nar and bpa bind to erα , they induce opposite effects on breast cancer cell growth . bpa induces cell proliferation , whereas nar only decreases the number of erα - positive cells ( i . e ., mcf - 7 and t47d ). notably , even in the presence of bpa , nar impairs breast cancer cell proliferation by activating caspase - 3 . the molecular pathways involved require p38 activation , whereas , the bpa - induced akt activation is completely prevented by the nar treatment . as a whole , nar maintains its proapoptotic effects even in the presence of the food contaminant bpa , thus , enlarging the chemopreventive potential of this flavanone .	0
comparison of migration from polyethersulphone and polycarbonate baby bottles .. this work presents two analytical methods developed for measuring three components of polyethersulphone ( pes ) and applying them to the migration testing of 30 baby bottles made of pes . the study also provides migration results under the same conditions for bisphenol a ( bpa ) from 40 polycarbonate baby bottles using a well - established method adapted to low concentrations . for pes bottles , migration of diphenyl sulphone ( dps ), 4 , 4 '- dichlorodiphenyl sulphone ( dcps ) and 4 , 4 '- dihydroxydiphenyl sulphone ( dhps ; also known as bisphenol s ) was carried out using two different analytical methods with detection limits of 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 µg / kg , and , therefore , much below their respective european commission directive 2002 / 72 / ec legislative migration limits of 50 - 3000 µg / kg , respectively . in parallel , 40 bottles made of polycarbonate were analysed for the migration of bpa using a method validated at eu level and modified to give a lower detection limit of 0 . 1 µg / kg . migration tests were conducted into the simulant for milk 50 % etoh ( as per commission regulation no . 321 / 2011 of 1 april 2011 ) according to the test conditions from the guidelines on test conditions for articles in contact with foodstuffs ( with a focus on kitchenware ) prepared by the eu reference laboratory and its network of national reference laboratories . none of the 30 bottles made of pes released any detectable amounts of dcps or dhps and only two bottles released a very low amount of dps of ~ 1 µg / kg in the milk food simulant compared to a regulatory limit of 3000 µg / kg . for pc bottles , 32 bottles of 40 ( 80 %) did not release bpa above the lod of 0 . 1 µg / kg ( in any of the three migration tests performed on each bottle ). the other 20 % of bottles exhibited only very minor migration , where the highest level in the first migration test was 1 . 83 µg / kg and most bottles did not release detectable bpa in the second and third test . only one bottle , with a migration level of 1 . 08 µg / kg , in the first test still showed a detectable level in the last migration test ( i . e . 0 . 42 µg / kg ). it is important to note that the legal limit ( european commission directive 2002 / 72 / ec ) was still 600 µg / kg for polycarbonate bottles at the time of purchase , preceding the precautionary ban taking effect from 1 june 2011 ( commission directive 2011 / 8 / eu ; commission regulation no . 321 / 2011 ). this confirms that the likelihood of migration of bpa is very low and remains at very minute amounts . the results also suggest the absence of release from pes bottles based on the set of bottles investigated .	0
influence of surface conditioning on bonding to polyetheretherketon ( peek ).. objective : the purpose of the study was the evaluation of the bond strength of a provisional resin to a polyetheretherketon ( peek ) using different surface treatments and conditioning methods . methods : peek disks were polished with 600grit rotating silicon carbide papers . plexiglas tubes were filled and bonded with a provisional resin ( luxatemp fluorescence ) to the peek disks which were air - abraded either with 110μm alumina particles ( rocatec pre ) and conditioned with the primers ecusit composite repair , luxatemp glaze & bond or clearfil ceramic primer or they were tribochemically silica - coated ( rocatec plus ) and silanated with espe sil or clearfil ceramic primer . air - abraded peek disks without priming served as control . subgroups of 8 specimens each were stored in distilled water at 37 ° c either for 3 days without thermal cycling ( tc ) or for 150 days with additional 37 , 500 thermal cycles between 5 and 55 ° c ( dwell time 30s ). following storage tensile bond strength ( tbs ) was tested at a crosshead speed of 2mm / min in a universal testing machine . statistical analysis was conducted with kruskal - wallis test followed by wilcoxon rank sum test adjusted by bonferroni - holm . results : after 3 days tbs ranged from 0 to 15 . 0mpa . after artificial aging over 150 days tbs ranged from 0 to 12 . 9mpa . using air - abrasion and priming with luxatemp glaze & bond resulted in significantly higher tbs than all other methods , which was also durable over time . conclusion : the use of the methylmethacrylate containing primer luxatemp glaze & bond after air - abrasion of peek surfaces can be recommended clinically as promising bonding method to peek .	0
a novel superparamagnetic surface molecularly imprinted nanoparticle adopting dummy template : an efficient solid - phase extraction adsorbent for bisphenol a .. leakage of the residual template molecules is one of the biggest challenges for application of molecularly imprinted polymer ( mip ) in solid - phase extraction ( spe ). in this study , bisphenol f ( bpf ) was adopted as a dummy template to prepare mip of bisphenol a ( bpa ) with a superparamagnetic core - shell nanoparticle as the supporter , aiming to avoid residual template leakage and to increase the efficiency of spe . characterization and test of the obtained products ( called mag - dmip beads ) revealed that these novel nanoparticles not only had excellent magnetic property but also displayed high selectivity to the target molecule bpa . as mag - dmip beads were adopted as the adsorbents of solid - phase extraction for detecting bpa in real water samples , the recoveries of spiked samples ranged from 84 . 7 % to 93 . 8 % with the limit of detection of 2 . 50 pg ml (- 1 ), revealing that mag - dmip beads were efficient spe adsorbents .	0

development of monoclonal antibody - based immunoassays for the analysis of bisphenol a in canned vegetables .. the aim of this work was the development of monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) and highly sensitive immunoassays ( elisas ) to bisphenol a ( bpa ), a well - known endocrine disruptor able to migrate from the internal coating of cans to food contained inside , particularly vegetables . to produce mabs to bpa , four synthetic compounds were conjugated to proteins and used as immunizing haptens in mice . by applying hybridoma technology , several mabs were produced and selected . these antibodies were characterized in the conjugate - coated and in the antibody - coated formats , using both homologous and heterologous conjugates . three indirect elisa based on the mabs showing the highest affinity to bpa were selected . the limit of detection of the most sensitive elisa was 0 . 22 nm ( 0 . 05 ng / ml ), with an i₅₀ value of around 1 nm ( 0 . 23 ng / ml ). an homologous elisa based on the mab bpab - 11 was applied to the simple , direct determination of bpa in the liquid portion of canned artichoke , peas , and sweet corn . only sample dilution in an appropriate saline buffer was required to minimize matrix effects and to enter the elisa working range . recovery and precision of the method were evaluated by spiking the liquid portion of these cans with bpa at 20 , 50 , and 100 ng / ml . coefficients of variation were below 20 % in most cases . with regard to recovery , the analytical data obtained were also acceptable . this immunoassay has therefore proved its potential as a new tool for the rapid , sensitive and accurate determination of bpa in canned food .	0
effect of air abrasion and thermocycling on resin adaptation and shear bond strength to dentin for an etch - and - rinse and self - etch resin adhesive .. this study examined the effect of air abrasion and thermocycling on the adaptation and shear bond strength , of composite resin bonded to dentin using etch - and - rinse and self - etch resin adhesives . confocal microscopy showed both adhesives closely adapted to dentin and a significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) greater number of resin tags were observed for the etch - and - rinse adhesive . air abrasion significantly increased resin tag length ( p < 0 . 05 ) for the etch - and - rinse adhesive and significantly increased the number ( p < 0 . 001 ), length ( p < 0 . 001 ) and thickness ( p < 0 . 01 ) of tags for the self - etch adhesive . however , air abrasion resulted in defect formation within the hybrid layer and thermocycling caused separation of the hybrid layer from adjacent dentin containing resin tags . a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) reduction in shear bond strength was observed for the etch - and - rinse adhesive following thermocycling . both adhesive systems adapted well to dentin in vitro and shear bond strengths were similar . the area of tag penetration into dentin was significantly ( p < 0 . 0001 ) enhanced following air abrasion .	0
reproductive health in humans and wildlife : are adverse trends associated with environmental chemical exposure ?. in recent years , evidence from disparate observations has indicated adverse changes in the reproductive health and fecundity of animals and humans . in humans , there is strong evidence for such trends in the incidences of testicular and female breast cancer , and concern has also been expressed regarding semen quality , cryptorchidism , hypospadias and polycystic ovaries . laboratory studies have indicated that some chemicals in the environment , both natural and synthetic , have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system and that these could , at least theoretically , be partly responsible for the observed changes . chemicals thus identified include the naturally occurring steroid hormones , phyto - and myco - estrogens , and anthropogenic chemicals such as synthetic hormones , organotins , organochlorine pesticides , polychlorinated biphenyls , dioxins , alkylphenol polyethoxylates , phthalates and bisphenol - a . while there is no direct evidence from human studies to confirm a causal link between exposure and effect , concern exists and is strengthened by reports of adverse reproductive and developmental effects in wildlife , possibly mediated via endocrine disruptive pathways . the development of imposex in neogastropod molluscs exposed to tributyltin has been attributed to such a mechanism and in wild populations of fish , alligators and birds , instances of masculinisation or feminisation in polluted areas have been noted . among mammals , disturbed fertility of florida panthers and some marine species has also been reported . a concentrated research and monitoring programme is required to clarify the nature and extent of effects on reproductive health in humans and wildlife , and to assess human and wildlife exposure to relevant naturally occurring or anthropogenic endocrine disrupting substances . this will enable a more robust evaluation of the contribution that environmental chemical exposure may have on adverse trends in the reproductive health of humans and wildlife .	0
retention and effectiveness of dental sealant after 15 years .. this landmark study of a pit and fissure sealant found 27 . 6 percent complete retention and 35 . 4 percent partial retention on permanent first molars . in the matched pair analysis , carious or restored surfaces made up 31 . 3 percent of the surfaces in the sealed group and 82 . 8 percent in the unsealed group .	0
microleakage of three generically different fluoride - releasing liner / bases .. three generically different fluoride - releasing materials that function as a liner or base were assessed for their microleakage performance on enamel and dentine . group 1 ( light - cured liner / base ) showed much more leakage , but less bulk absorption of tracer , than group 2 ( traditional glass ionomer ) or group 3 ( light - cured glass ionomer ). the response of the three materials to tracer penetration was consistent with what is known about their chemistry . the group 2 and 3 materials are probably the materials of choice at the caries - vulnerable margins , which are not easily visible for inspection .	0
occlusal wear of a resin - modified glass ionomer cement following three surface treatments .. unacceptable occlusal wear has been reported for resin - modified glass ionomer cements ( rmgics ) placed in permanent molar teeth . three different surface treatments of a rmgic were evaluated over periods of up to 2 years for their effects on restoration wear behaviour : ( a ) sealing with a thin layer of low viscosity unfilled resin ( sealed restoration ), ( b ) sealing with a thicker layer of a lightly - filled pit and fissure sealant ( sealant restoration ), and ( c ) co - curing the rmgic with a posterior resin composite ( co - cured restoration ). after 2 years the cumulative median ( quartiles ) wear was for ( a ) 100 ( 50 - 150 ) microns , ( b ) 25 ( 0 - 50 ) microns , and ( c ) 25 ( 25 - 38 ) microns . although method ( b ) effectively reduced the surface wear of the rmgic , this treatment required frequent re - sealing , involving 52 % of the restorations . sealing the surface of a rmgic placed in permanent molars was not a satisfactory method for reducing occlusal wear . however , co - curing the rmgic with a posterior resin composite reduced occlusal wear significantly ( p < 0 . 0001 ), without the need for frequent reapplications of a pit and fissure sealant to the rmgic .	0
evaluation of oral and intravenous route pharmacokinetics , plasma protein binding , and uterine tissue dose metrics of bisphenol a : a physiologically based pharmacokinetic approach .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a weakly estrogenic monomer used in the production of polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins , both of which are used in food contact and other applications . a physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( pbpk ) model of bpa pharmacokinetics in rats and humans was developed to provide a physiological context in which the processes controlling bpa pharmacokinetics ( e . g ., plasma protein binding , enterohepatic recirculation of the glucuronide [ bpag ]) could be incorporated . a uterine tissue compartment was included to allow the correlation of simulated estrogen receptor ( er ) binding of bpa with increases in uterine wet weight ( uww ) in rats . intravenous - and oral - route blood kinetics of bpa in rats and oral - route plasma and urinary elimination kinetics in humans were well described by the model . simulations of rat oral - route bpag pharmacokinetics were less exact , most likely the result of oversimplification of the gi tract compartment . comparison of metabolic clearance rates derived from fitting rat i . v . and oral - route data implied that intestinal glucuronidation of bpa is significant . in rats , but not humans , terminal elimination rates were strongly influenced by enterohepatic recirculation . in the absence of bpa binding to plasma proteins , simulations showed high er occupancy at doses without uterine effects . restricting free bpa to the measured unbound amount demonstrated the importance of including plasma binding in bpa kinetic models : the modeled relationship between er occupancy and uww increases was consistent with expectations for a receptor - mediated response with low er occupancy at doses with no response and increasing occupancy with larger increases in uww .	0

effect of combining in vitro estrogenicity data with kinetic characteristics of estrogenic compounds on the in vivo predictive value .. with the ultimate aim of increasing the utility of in vitro assays for toxicological risk assessment , a method was developed to calculate in vivo estrogenic potencies from in vitro estrogenic potencies of compounds by taking into account systemic availability . in vitro estrogenic potencies of three model compounds ( bisphenol a , genistein , and 4 - nonylphenol ) relative to ethinylestradiol ( ee2 ), determined with the estrogen receptor alpha ( erα ) transcriptional activation assay using her - hela - 9903 cells , were taken from literature and used to calculate the ee2 equivalent ( ee2eq ) effect doses in the predominantly erα - dependent rat uterotrophic assay . compound - specific differences in hepatic clearance relative to the reference compound ee2 were determined in vitro to examine whether in vivo estrogenic potencies reported in literature could be more accurately estimated . the ee2eq doses allowed to predict in vivo uterotrophic responses within a factor of 6 - 25 and the inclusion of the hepatic clearance further improved the prediction with a factor 1 . 6 - 2 . 1 for especially genistein and bisphenol a . yet , the model compounds still were less potent in vivo than predicted based on their ee2 equivalent estrogenic potency and hepatic clearance . for further improvement of the in vitro to in vivo predictive value of in vitro assays , the relevance of other kinetic characteristics should be studied , including binding to carrier proteins , oral bioavailability and the formation of estrogenic metabolites .	0
bisphenol a activates maxi - k ( k ( ca ) 1 . 1 ) channels in coronary smooth muscle .. background and purpose : bisphenol a ( bpa ) is used to manufacture plastics , including containers for food into which it may leach . high levels of exposure to this oestrogenic endocrine disruptor are associated with diabetes and heart disease . oestrogen and oestrogen receptor modulators increase the activity of large conductance ca ( 2 +)/ voltage - sensitive k (+) ( maxi - k ; k ( ca ) 1 . 1 ) channels , but the effects of bpa on maxi - k channels are unknown . we tested the hypothesis that bpa activates maxi - k channels through a mechanism that depends upon the regulatory beta1 subunit . experimental approach : patch - clamp recordings of maxi - k channels were made in human and canine coronary smooth muscle cells as well as in ad - 293 cells expressing pore - forming alpha or alpha plus beta1 subunits . key results : bpa ( 10 microm ) activated an outward current in smooth muscle cells that was inhibited by penitrem a ( 1 microm ), a maxi - k blocker . bpa increased maxi - k activity in inside - out patches from coronary smooth muscle , but had no effect on single channel conductance . in ad - 293 cells with maxi - k channels composed of alpha subunits alone , 10 microm bpa did not affect channel activity . when channels in ad - 293 cells contained beta1 subunits , 10 microm bpa increased channel activity . effects of bpa were rapid (< 1 min ) and reversible . a higher concentration of bpa ( 100 microm ) increased maxi - k current independent of the beta1 subunit . conclusions and implications : our data indicate that bpa increased the activity of maxi - k channels and may represent a basis for some potential toxicological effects .	0
bisphenol analogues in sediments from industrialized areas in the united states , japan , and korea : spatial and temporal distributions .. bisphenol analogues are used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins . despite the widespread use of bisphenols , few studies have reported the occurrence of compounds other than bisphenol a ( bpa ) in sediment . in this study , concentrations and profiles of eight bisphenol analogues were determined using high - performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( hplc - ms / ms ) in sediments collected from several industrialized areas in the united states ( u . s .), japan , and korea . the total concentrations of bisphenols ( σbps ; sum of eight bisphenols ) in sediment ranged from below the limit of quantitation ( loq ) to 25 , 300 ng / g dry weight ( dw ), with a mean value of 201 ng / g dw . sediment samples from lake shihwa , korea , contained the highest concentrations of both individual and total bisphenols . among individual bisphenols , bpa and bisphenol f ( bpf ) were the predominant compounds , accounting for 64 % and 30 % of the total bisphenol concentrations in sediment . we also examined vertical profiles of concentrations of bisphenol analogues in sediment cores from the u . s . and japan . sediment cores from the u . s . showed a gradual decline in the concentrations of bisphenols as compared to the past decade . bpa concentrations were found to decline in a sediment core from tokyo bay , but bisphenol s ( bps ) was more frequently detected in core sections that represent the most recent decade , which is consistent with the replacement of bpa with bps in some applications since 2001 in japan .	0
bond strength and clinical efficiency for two light guide sizes in orthodontic bracket bonding .. the purpose of this study was to establish a possible increase in efficiency in bracket bonding with light - cured adhesive by using a larger size on the light transmitting unit . two light guides were compared , a standard - sized 11 - mm light guide and a 19 - mm elliptical extra broad light guide , the latter designed to allow simultaneously curing of two adjacent brackets . fifty extracted human premolars mounted in five phantom maxillary arches were bonded according to a standard procedure with mini uni - twin stainless steel brackets . the two light guides were randomly chosen for each half of the maxillary arch . after bonding , all teeth were tested for tensile bond strength to failure . in the clinical study 30 patients were bonded according to a split mouth technique with the two light guides alternatively used randomly for each side of the jaw . time for bonding and the occurrence of bracket failures were recorded . the results showed no statistically significant differences between the standard and elliptical light guides regarding tensile bond strength , or bracket failure frequency . however , with the larger light guide size a significantly shorter total bonding time for each patient was required . it is therefore concluded that the elliptical light guide in combination with a light transmitting unit of sufficient quality gave a similar bonding result as the standard light guide , offering the clinician a reduction in chair side time during the bonding procedure .	0
a prospective clinical study of a multipurpose adhesive used for the cementation of resin - bonded bridges .. a clinical trial was conducted to assess comparatively the clinical performance of anterior resin - bonded bridges ( rbbs ) cemented with panavia 21 opaque ( po ) or scotchbond multi - purpose plus ( sbmp ) used in conjunction with scotchbond resin cement ( src ). thirty - three bridges were cemented with po and 31 bridges with src . the bridges were assessed six months after placement via a postal questionnaire . two bridges ( one in each group ) failed at that stage . clinical assessments at one year revealed that one po bridge and five src bridges had failed . chi - squared analysis , however , showed no significant difference ( p > 0 . 05 ) in the retention rate of the two groups . at the end of two years , eight bridges had failed ( three po and five src ). chi - squared analysis again revealed no significant difference in the retention rate provided by the two adhesives . greyness of the abutment teeth of bridges cemented with src was a drawback in using this material . many operators who participated in the trial felt the use of src / sbmp was time - consuming and rather complicated .	0
influence of different tooth types on the bond strength of two orthodontic adhesive systems .. the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of different tooth types on the shear bond strength ( sbs ) of two orthodontic resin adhesive systems in vitro . two hundred extracted sound human teeth were used in the study . ten teeth of each tooth type were the mounted in acrylic resin leaving the buccal surface of the crowns parallel to the base of the moulds . in each experimental group , the adhesives ( transbond xt and light bond ) were applied to the etched enamel surfaces . the orthodontic composite resins were then applied to the surface in cylindrical - shaped plastic matrices . for sbs testing , a force transducer ( ultradent ) was applied at a crosshead speed of 1 mm / minute at the interface between the tooth and composite until failure occurred . data were analysed using two - way analysis of variance ( anova ), kruskal - wallis one - way anova , a bonferroni adjusted mann - whitney u - test , and an independent t - test . generally , it was found that tooth type had a significant effect on sbs ( p < 0 . 05 ) with light bond showing a higher sbs than transbond xt ( p < 0 . 05 ). the highest bond strengths were observed for the upper central incisor and lower molars with light bond ( p < 0 . 05 ) and the lowest mean bond strengths for the upper molars and lower canine with transbond xt ( p < 0 . 05 ). the results demonstrated that enamel sbs was significantly altered by both tooth type and adhesive system . thus , the findings of this study confirm that enamel bond strength is not uniform for all teeth . these results may also explain the variability in the enamel - bonding efficacy of adhesives .	0
dentine bond strength and microleakage of flowable composite , compomer and glass ionomer cement .. background : to assess in vitro the dentine bond strength and microleakage of three class v restorations viz . flowable composite , compomer and glass ionomer cement . methods : eighteen dentine specimens were prepared and randomly distributed among three groups . three kinds of restoration materials were each bonded on prepared dentine surfaces in three groups as per the manufacturers ' instructions . group aelite : tyrian spe ( a no - rinse , self - priming etchant ) + one step plus ( an universal dental adhesive ) + aeliteflo ( a flowable composite ); group dyract : prime & bond nt ( a no - rinse , self - priming dental adhesive ) + dyract ap ( a compomer ); group glasionomer : glasionomer type ii ( a self - cured restorative glass ionomer ). fifteen dentine / restoration microtensile bond test specimens were prepared from each group and were subjected to microtensile bond strength testing . the bond interfaces were observed morphologically using a scanning electron microscope ( sem ). twenty - four cervical cavities of 4 . 0 mm mesiodistal length , 2 . 0 mm occlusogingival height and 1 . 5 mm depth were prepared at the cemento - enamel junction ( cej ) on both buccal and lingual surfaces of each tooth . the cavities were each filled with flowable composite ( group aelite ), compomer ( group dyract ) and glass ionomer cement ( group glasionomer ) using the same material and methods as for the microtensile bond tests . microleakage of each restoration was evaluated by the ratio of the length of methylene blue penetration along the tooth - restoration interface and the total length of the dentine cavity wall on the cut surface . results : one - way anova and least significant difference ( lsd ) tests revealed statistically significant differences among the dentine bond strength for group aelite ( 28 . 4 mpa ), group dyract ( 15 . 1 mpa ) and group glasionomer ( 2 . 5 mpa ). sem images showed intimate adaptation in the restoration / dentine interfaces of group aelite and group dyract . all of the systems tested in this study presented microleakage . however , both group aelite ( 0 . 808 ) and group dyract ( 0 . 863 ) had significantly less microleakage than group glasionomer ( 0 . 964 ). there were no statistically significant microleakage differences between group aelite and group dyract , and no statistically significant microleakage differences between the occlusal margin and gingival margin . conclusions : none of the systems tested in this study completely eliminated microleakage . however , both the flowable composite and compomer provided stronger dentine bond strengths and better margin sealing than the conventional glass ionomer cement . occlusal forces exerted the same effects on microleakage of the occlusal margin and gingival margin in cervical cavities .	0

cetyltrimethylammonium bromide - coated magnetic nanoparticles for the preconcentration of phenolic compounds from environmental water samples .. the research presented in this paper investigates the adsorption of cation surfactants -- cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ( ctab ) and cetylpyridinium chloride ( cpc )-- onto magnetic nanoparticles and the application of this mixed hemimicelles solid - phase extraction ( spe ) method for the preconcentration of several typical phenolic compounds - bisphenol a ( bpa ), 4 - tertoctylphenol ( 4 - op ), and 4 - n - nonylphenol ( 4 - np )-- from environmental water samples . in this novel spe method , the charged surfactants ctab and cpc form mixed hemimicelles on fe3o4 nanoparticles ( fe3o4 nps ), which causes retention of analytes by strong hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions . the spe method combines the advantages of mixed hemimicelles and magnetic nanoparticles . in order to provide guidelines forthe mixed hemimicelles spe method development , surfactant adsorption isotherms and zeta - potential isotherms were also investigated . the main factors affecting the adsolubilization of analytes , such as the amount of fe3o4 nps and surfactants , the type of surfactants , the solution ph , the sample loading volume , and the desorption conditions , were investigated and optimized . a concentration factor of 800 was achieved by the extraction of 800 ml of several environmental water samples using this spe method . under the selected conditions , detection limits obtained for bpa , 4 - op , and 4 - np were 12 , 29 , 34 ng / l , respectively . the accuracy of the method was evaluated by recovery measurements on spiked samples , and good recoveries ( 68 - 104 %) with low relative standard deviations from 2 to 7 % were achieved . the advantages of this new spe method include high extraction yields , high breakthrough volumes , short analysis times , and easy preparation of sorbents . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that a mixed hemimicelles spe method based on magnetic separation and nanoparticles has been used for the pretreatment of environmental water samples .	0
efficacy of dentin - bonding agents in relation to application technique .. the gap - reducing efficacy of two dentin - bonding agents was examined in butt - joint dentin cavities prepared in extracted human teeth . the cavity wall and the surrounding dentin surface were treated with one of the dentin - bonding agents , and a light - activated microfilled restorative resin was either applied and polymerized or applied and then withdrawn from the cavity and once again applied before polymerization . ten minutes after polymerization the width and the extent of the contraction gap were measured , using a light microscope , approximately 0 . 1 mm below the original free surface of the fillings . the marginal porosity was also registered and calculated in percentage of the total filling periphery . it was found that reapplication resulted in an increased marginal porosity and also that the width and extent of the contraction gap were increased when the restorative resin was reapplied .	0
cornus kousa f . buerger ex miquel increases glucose uptake through activation of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor γ and insulin sensitization .. aim of the study : cornus kousa f . buerger ex miquel , an oriental medicinal plant , has been traditionally used for the treatment of hyperglycemia , but its molecular mechanism remains unknown . the goal of this study was to investigate the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor γ ( pparγ ) ligand - binding activity of cornus kousa and to determine the effects of cornus kousa on insulin sensitization in 3t3 - l1 cells for the treatment of type 2 diabetes . materials and methods : pparγ luciferase transactivation assay was used to evaluate the pparγ ligand - binding activity of cornus kousa leaf extract . western blot analysis , oil red o staining , and glucose uptake assay were performed to evaluate pparγ agonistic activity and insulin sensitizing effects of cornus kousa leaf extract ( cke ) in 3t3 - l1 cells . results : cke increased pparγ ligand - binding activity in a dose - dependent manner . in addition , cke enhanced adipogenesis and the expression of pparγ target proteins , including glucose transporter 4 ( glut4 ) and adiponectin , as well as proteins involved in adipogenesis , including pparγ and ccaat / enhancer binding protein α ( c / ebpα ) in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes . furthermore , cke led to significant induction of glucose uptake and stimulated insulin signaling , but not to activation of amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) signaling . the enhanced glucose uptake by cke were abolished by treatment with bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ), a pparγ antagonist , or ly294002 , an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( pi3k ), but not by compound c , an ampk inhibitor . conclusion : consistent with the high pparγ ligand - binding activity , cke increased glucose uptake through pparγ activation and insulin signaling . these results suggest that cke could have pharmacological effects for the treatment of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes .	0
effect of adhesive luting agents on the marginal seating of cast restorations .. this study determined the effect of new adhesive luting agents on the marginal seating of cast restorations . standardized preparations were completed on freshly extracted premolars , impressions were made , and complete metal veneer crowns were cast with a base metal alloy . the castings were placed on their respective teeth and the extent of marginal opening was recorded . they were then assigned to a luting agent group : glass ionomer cement ( gi ), polycarboxylate cement ( pc ), microfilled bis - gma composite resin with npg - gma / pmdm dentinal bonding agent ( gma + npg ), microfilled bis - gma / phosphate ester composite resin ( gma / pe ), or zinc phosphate cement ( zp ). the castings were cemented and marginal openings remeasured . anova revealed that the cement groups were similar before cementation ( p 0 . 35 ) but were different after cementation ( p < 0 . 0001 ). tukey ' s multiple comparisons test identified statistically similar groups that were different from other groups and ranked them from lesser to greater marginal opening : ( gi , zp , pc ) ( gma / pe , gma + npg ).	0

effects of endocrine modulators on sexual differentiation and reproductive function in male japanese quail .. a number of environmental contaminants have been shown to interfere with the endocrine system . many of these compounds bind to estrogen receptors , thereby potentially disrupting estrogen - regulated functions . in this paper , we review some background data on avian sexual differentiation and present some of the results from our studies on effects of estrogenic chemicals administered during sexual differentiation in the japanese quail . initially , our goal was to elucidate whether a decreased male sexual behavior in quail is a suitable endpoint for studying long - term effects of exposure to estrogenic compounds during sexual differentiation in ovo . we thereafter tested some environmental pollutants , suspected to act via mimicking estrogens , using the test system developed . results from our studies on the synthetic estrogens ethinylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol , as well as the environmental pollutants bisphenol a , tetrabromobisphenol a , and o , p '- ddt are reviewed in this paper . we conclude that the japanese quail is well suited as an animal model for studying various long - term effects after embryonic exposure to estrogenic compounds . depressed sexual behavior proved to be the most sensitive of the variables studied in males and we find this endpoint appropriate for studying effects of endocrine modulating chemicals in the adult quail following embryonic exposure .	0
protective effect of pit and fissure sealants on demineralization of adjacent enamel .. purpose : this study ' s purpose was to evaluate the in vitro effect of sealants in protecting adjacent enamel from acid demineralization . methods : occlusal fissures of extracted molars ( n = 10 ) were sealed with : conventional nonfluoride ( do ; delton opaque ) resin - based sealant ( rbs ); fluoride - containing rbs ( us ; ultraseal xt plus , and cp ; clinpro ); amorphous calcium phosphate - containing rbs ( bw ; bosworth aegis ); or glass ionomer sealant ( ft ; fuji triage ). the specimens were immersed in lactic acid gel for 20 days to create demineralized lesions on the occlusal enamel . cross - sectional microhardness was measured at the lesion 0 . 5 mm from the sealant margin . mineral loss ( δz , volume % mineral x μm ) was calculated from the microhardness values and subjected to analysis of variance and student - newman - keuls tests . results : mineral loss values ( mean ± sd ) were : 1 , 975 ± 806 , 1 , 802 ± 512 , 1 , 004 ± 421 , 1 , 275 ± 375 , and 88 ± 124 for do , us , cp , bw , and ft , respectively ; δz for do and us was significantly higher , and δz for ft was significantly lower than that for cp and bw ( p =. 05 ). conclusions : resin - based sealants containing fluoride or amorphous calcium phosphate may provide some protective effect on demineralization of adjacent enamel vs conventional nonfluoride sealant . glass ionomer sealant was the most effective in protecting adjacent enamel from acid demineralization .	0
d - amphetamine - related reinforcing effects are reduced in mice exposed prenatally to estrogenic endocrine disruptors .. estrogenic endocrine disruptors are hormonally active compounds that can bind to estradiol receptors . central dopamine pathways have been reported to be affected by early developmental exposure to estrogenic endocrine disruptors . in the present study , pregnant female cd - 1 mice were allowed to drink spontaneously either oil or environmentally relevant low doses of two estrogenic compounds , methoxychlor ( 20 microg / kg ) or bisphenol - a ( 10 microg / kg ) during gestation days 11 - 18 . their adult offspring were assessed for conditioned place preference produced by d - amphetamine ( 0 , 1 or 2 mg / kg ). interestingly , prenatal treatment effects were sex - dependent and no changes in conditioned place preference emerged for the male offspring . conversely , a clear - cut profile of d - amphetamine - induced conditioned place preference was only shown by oil - exposed females , whereas exposure to bisphenol - a or methoxychlor resulted in little or no place conditioning . locomotor effects of acute d - amphetamine were not affected by prenatal exposure to bisphenol - a or methoxychlor . as a whole , prenatal exposure to estrogenic endocrine disruptors affected some steps in the organization of the brain dopaminergic systems in the female offspring , thus leading to long - term alterations in neurobehavioral function . these data confirm that exposure to weak environmental estrogens in the period of brain sexual differentiation can influence adult behavior .	0

chronic exposure to low doses bisphenol a interferes with pair - bonding and exploration in female mongolian gerbils .. estrogenic endocrine disruptors , synthetic or naturally occurring substances found in the environment , can interfere with the vertebrate endocrine system and , mimicking estrogens , interact with the neuroendocrine substrates of behavior . since species vary in their sensitivity to steroids , it is of great interest to widen the range of species included in the researches on neurobehavioral effects of estrogenic endocrine disruptors . we examined socio - sexual and exploratory behavior of mongolian gerbil females ( meriones unguiculatus ), a monogamous rodent , in response to chronic exposure to the estrogenic endocrine disruptor bisphenol a . paired females were daily administered with one of the following treatments : bisphenol a ( 2 or 20 microg / kg body weight / day ); 17alpha - ethynil estradiol ( 0 . 04 microg / kg body weight / day 17alphae ); oil ( vehicle ). females were treated for 3 weeks after pairing . starting on day of pairing , social interactions within pairs were daily recorded . three weeks after pairing , females were individually tested in a free exploratory paradigm . bisphenol a and 17alphae affected male - female social interactions by increasing social investigation . bisphenol a reduced several exploratory parameters , indicating a decreased exploratory propensity of females . these results highlight the sensitivity of adult female gerbils to bisphenol a during the hormonally sensitive period of pair formation , also considering that the bisphenol a doses tested are well below the suggested human tolerable daily intake .	0
bisphenol - a exposure during pregnancy and lactation affects maternal behavior in rats .. in mammals , endogenous estrogens are crucial for sexual differentiation during the perinatal period , and the modulation in adulthood of many neuroendocrine and behavioral functions involved in reproduction . in rats , the estrogenic environment during pregnancy and lactation affects directly maternal behavior . this experiment was aimed to test whether the exposure to the estrogenic compound bisphenol - a ( bpa ; 0 . 040 mg / kg / die , orally ) of adult female rats , from mating to weaning of the pups , could alter maternal behavior . an appropriate methodology was applied to reveal differences in the behavior of dams directed to male and female pups , testing the dams on postnatal days 3 - 4 and 8 - 9 . results show different maternal behavioral patterns towards male and female pups of control mothers , with more ano - genital licking to males than to females . exposure of mothers to bpa modified their behavior , reducing specific components of maternal behavior , both active and passive , irrespective of the sex of pups and the period of observation . this experiment shows that maternal behavior is affected by a prolonged exposure to a low dose of bpa during pregnancy and lactation , thus suggesting an effect on neural circuits in adulthood .	0
early exposure to a low dose of bisphenol a affects socio - sexual behavior of juvenile female rats .. play behavior is affected by alteration of the hormonal environment during development . in fact , congenital adrenal hyperplasia or early administration of diethylstilbestrol are able to modify female play behavior in mammals . in this research , play behavior of female rats was used to explore the effects of perinatal exposure to low , environmentally relevant dose of bisphenol a ( bpa ), a xenoestrogen widely diffused in the environment . we used 18 females born to mothers exposed to 40 microg / kg / day bpa during pregnancy and lactation , and 18 control females . the subjects were observed in a heterosexual social situation from 35 to 55 days of age . six main behaviors were identified by principal component analysis ( pca ): exploration , defensive behavior to males , play behavior with males , play behavior with females , low - intensity mating behavior , social grooming . early administration of bpa was responsible for a significant increase of exploration ( including social investigation ) ( p < 0 . 001 ), as well as a decrease of play with males ( p < 0 . 02 ) and social grooming ( p < 0 . 01 ) at 45 days of age , indicating a general decrease of playful interactions . in general our results suggest that bpa does not induce a clear masculinization of female behavior , but is able however to defeminize some aspects of female behavior . this result is compatible with the estrogenic properties of bpa , and suggests caution in the use of a chemical that , in the range of human exposure , is able to influence the development of the brain during a critical period , resulting in long - term effects on behavior .	0
effects of the xenoestrogen bisphenol a in diencephalic regions of the teleost fish coris julis occur preferentially via distinct somatostatin receptor subtypes .. the xenoestrogen bisphenol a , a contaminant used in the manufacturing of polymers for many consumer products , has been shown to mimic estrogenic actions . this xenoestrogen regulates secretion and expression of pituitary lactotrophs plus morphological and structural features of estrogen target tissues in rodents . recently , ecological hazards produced by bisphenol a have drawn interests towards the effects of this environmental chemical on neurobiological functions of aquatic vertebrates of which little is known . in this study , the effects of bisphenol a on the distribution of the biologically more active somatostatin receptor subtypes in diencephalic regions of the teleost fish coris julis were assessed using nonpeptide agonists ( l - 779 , 976 and l - 817 , 818 ) that are highly selective for subtype ( 2 ) and subtype ( 5 ), respectively . bisphenol a proved to be responsible for highly significant increased binding levels of subtype ( 2 ) in hypothalamic areas , while markedly decreased levels of subtype ( 5 ) were found in these diencephalic areas , as well as in the medial preglomerular nucleus . the extensive distribution of somatostatin receptor subtype ( 2 ) and subtype ( 5 ) in the teleost diencephalic areas suggests that , like in mammals , this receptor system may not only be involved in enhanced hypophysiotropic neurohormonal functions but might also promote neuroplasticity events .	0
on - line solid - phase microextraction of triclosan , bisphenol a , chlorophenols , and selected pharmaceuticals in environmental water samples by high - performance liquid chromatography - ultraviolet detection .. a method using on - line solid - phase microextraction ( spme ) on a carbowax - templated fiber followed by liquid chromatography ( lc ) with ultraviolet ( uv ) detection was developed for the determination of triclosan in environmental water samples . along with triclosan , other selected phenolic compounds , bisphenol a , and acidic pharmaceuticals were studied . previous spme / lc or stir - bar sorptive extraction / lc - uv for polar analytes showed lack of sensitivity . in this study , the calculated octanol - water distribution coefficient ( log d ) values of the target analytes at different ph values were used to estimate polarity of the analytes . the lack of sensitivity observed in earlier studies is identified as a lack of desorption by strong polar - polar interactions between analyte and solid - phase . calculated log d values were useful to understand or predict the interaction between analyte and solid phase . under the optimized conditions , the method detection limit of selected analytes by using on - line spme - lc - uv method ranged from 5 to 33 ng l (- 1 ), except for very polar 3 - chlorophenol and 2 , 4 - dichlorophenol which was obscured in wastewater samples by an interfering substance . this level of detection represented a remarkable improvement over the conventional existing methods . the on - line spme - lc - uv method , which did not require derivatization of analytes , was applied to the determination of tcs including phenolic compounds and acidic pharmaceuticals in tap water and river water and municipal wastewater samples .	0
teratogenic and anti - metamorphic effects of bisphenol a on embryonic and larval xenopus laevis .. effects of bisphenol a ( bpa ) on embryonic and larval development were investigated . in xenopus laevis blastulae treated with 2 . 5 - 3 . 0 x 10 (- 5 ) m bpa or with 10 (- 5 ) m 17beta estradiol ( e2 ), malformation of the head region , scoliosis ( curved vertebrate ), and suppression of organogenesis were observed . in addition , 10 (- 5 )- 10 (- 4 ) m bpa blocked tri - iodothyronine ( t3 )- inducible resorption of the tail segments from premetamorphic ( stage 52 - 54 ) larvae in vitro . when stage 52 tadpoles were immersed in 1 . 0 - 2 . 5 x 10 (- 5 ) m bpa , deceleration of both spontaneous and thyroxin ( t4 )- induced metamorphic changes occurred . furthermore , bpa suppressed thyroid hormone receptor ( tr ) beta gene expression both in vivo and in vitro . thus , we concluded that bpa at the concentrations examined affects both embryonic development and larval metamorphosis .	0
the different effects of endocrine - disrupting chemicals on estrogen receptor - mediated transcription through interaction with coactivator trap220 in uterine tissue .. an endocrine - disrupting chemical ( edc ) can alter endocrine functions through a variety of mechanisms , including nuclear receptor - mediated changes in protein synthesis , interference with membrane receptor binding , steroidogenesis or synthesis of other hormones . although major chemicals have been shown to disrupt estrogenic actions mainly through their binding to estrogen receptor ( er ) or androgen receptor , it is not clear how edcs affect endocrine functions in vivo . we present evidence that the edcs bisphenol a and phthalate activate er - mediated transcription through interaction with trap220 . moreover , bisphenol a had positive effects on the interaction between er - beta and trap220 and on the expression of er - beta and trap220 compared with phthalate and estradiol in uterine tissue . these data suggested that some edcs might alter endocrine function through the change of the receptor and coactivator levels in uterine tissue and through the different effect on the interaction between ers and coactivator trap220 .	0
the influence of temperature on some physical properties of dental composites .. in this study diametral tensile strength and microhardness of composites were investigated in relation to various temperatures during curing . it has been demonstrated that temperatures elevated up to 60 degrees c can improve the mechanical properties considerably . also the stability of the resin system in aggressive environments was improved due to more efficient cross - linking . thermal analysis of the material showed an endothermic reaction between 60 and 70 degrees c that is believed to be responsible for the initiation of the extra cross - linking . heating of composite fillings during clinical use is suggested .	0
subsurface deformation associated with hardness measurements of composites .. this study was prompted after a series of composites had been hardness - tested with the vickers ( pyramidal diamond indenter ) and barcol tests ( flat - ended steel cone indenter ). the results were found to differ markedly from the supplied barcol / vickers conversion chart . a sectioning and silver staining technique was therefore developed to examine the modes of subsurface deformation of four composites under the two indenters . under the vickers indentations , the large particle hybrid , occlusin , showed a clear hemispherical area of subsurface disruption while the small particle hybrid , brilliant dentin , had a less distinct zone of disruption . the microfilled materials , heliomolar and isosit , showed minimal silver uptake , suggesting a less disruptive mode of plastic deformation . under the barcol indentations , occlusion and brilliant dentin produced clear hemispherical zones of deformation , while heliomolar and isosit were badly crazed with distinctive patterns of subsurface flaws . these consistent patterns of failure to some extent explain the comparison of hardness measurements and may be of use in explaining the wear mechanisms of composite restorations .	0
chemomechanical caries removal in children : efficacy and efficiency .. background : the authors investigated the effectiveness of chemomechanical caries removal ( cmcr ) compared with the traditional method ( tm ) of caries removal using a round bur when treating dentinal - depth occlusal lesions with minimal enamel access in primary molars . the authors also compare cmcr with tm to determine if it had a higher efficacy and could be used more frequently without the subject ' s having to undergo local anesthesia . methods : the authors collected data from 50 children during operative appointments at which caries was removed using one of the two methods . results : complete caries removal within 15 minutes was achieved in only 57 . 7 percent of the cmcr - treated teeth . in 42 . 3 percent of these teeth , residual caries was removed using tm . cmcr was almost eight times more time - consuming than was tm when used to excavate dentinal - depth occlusal lesions with minimal cavitation . there was no significant difference between cmcr and tm in the number of subjects who needed to undergo local anesthesia . conclusions : the authors found no direct clinical advantage in using cmcr over using tm for treating occlusal dentinal lesions with minimal cavitation in pediatric patients .	0
release of bisphenol - a from a light - cured adhesive bonded to lingual fixed retainers .. introduction : our aim was to quantitatively determine the bisphenol - a ( bpa ) released from a light - cured orthodontic adhesive used to bond lingual fixed retainers . methods : eighteen recently extracted premolars , divided into 3 groups of 6 teeth each , were embedded in plaster in an arch shape . a light - cured adhesive ( transbond xt , 3m unitek , monrovia , calif ) was bonded to a . 0195 - in , 3 - strand heat - treated twist flex wire ( wildcat , gac international , bohemia , ny ) adjusted to the lingual surface of the teeth , and the arches were immersed in doubled - distilled water for 10 , 20 , and 30 days . the concentration of bpa in the 3 eluents was investigated with gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy ; all assays were performed in triplicate , and the results were averaged . results : measurable amounts of bpa were identified for all groups , with the highest found in the immersion media of the 1 - month groups ( 2 . 9 μg / l ), whereas the control ( tooth storage solution ) had 0 . 16 μg / l . conclusions : the bpa released from a light - cured adhesive used to bond lingual fixed retainers might be assigned to the application mode of the material that differs from conventional use . further testing including estrogenicity assays will assess the potential estrogenic action of this application . composite restorative resins should replace orthodontic adhesives that were not intended to function with their surfaces in the oral cavity ; alternatively , canine - bonded fixed retainers might reduce the amount of adhesive used .	0
preparation of tio2 / epoxy nanocomposites by ultrasonic dispersion and their structure property relationship .. by the insertion of nanoparticles into a polymer matrix a considerable improvement of mechanical properties can be achieved . therefore , a homogeneous distribution of fillers within the matrix is required . in the present paper the dispersion of tio ( 2 )- nanoparticles in a dgeba ( diglycidyl ether of bisphenol a ) epoxy resin by means of an ultrasonic horn was studied . the systematic examination of process parameters of a previous study was completed in order to determine the optimum processing window leading to a good dispersion result without degrading the molecular structure of the epoxy resin . therefore , particle sizes were examined using a dynamic light scattering device , and the effect of the ultrasonic treatment on the resin was surveyed by ft - ir spectroscopy ( fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ). furthermore , the mechanical performance of the nanocomposites was examined for various contents of tio ( 2 )- nanoparticles to show that the materials prepared by ultrasonic dispersion show an improved property ' s profile . in order to understand the reinforcing mechanisms of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix providing improved mechanical properties , scanning electron microscope ( sem ) pictures of the fracture surfaces of the samples were carried out , which revealed that nanocomposites show a significantly rougher surface than the neat epoxy resin . this indicates a change in the fracture mechanisms .	0
novel roles of prolactin and estrogens in breast cancer : resistance to chemotherapy .. resistance to chemotherapy is a major complication in the treatment of advanced breast cancer . estrogens and prolactin ( prl ) are implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer but their roles in chemoresistance have been overlooked . a common feature to the two hormones is activation of their receptors by diverse compounds , which mimic or antagonize their actions . the prl receptor is activated by lactogens ( prl , gh , or placental lactogen ) originating from the pituitary , breast , adipose tissue , or the placenta . estrogen receptors exist in multiple membrane - associated and cytoplasmic forms that can be activated by endogenous estrogens , man - made chemicals , and phytoestrogens . here , we review evidence that low doses of prl , estradiol ( e ( 2 )), and bisphenol a ( bpa ) antagonize multiple anticancer drugs that induce cell death by different mechanisms . focusing on cisplatin , a dna - damaging drug which is effective in the treatment of many cancer types but not breast cancer , we compare the abilities of prl , e ( 2 ), and bpa to antagonize its cytotoxicity . whereas prl acts by activating the glutathione - s - transferase detoxification enzyme , e ( 2 ) and bpa act by inducing the antiapoptotic protein bcl - 2 . the implications of these findings to patients undergoing chemotherapy are discussed .	0
chairside replacement of posterior teeth using a prefabricated fiber - reinforced resin composite framework technique : a case report .. unlabelled : the fixed replacement of a single posterior missing tooth for those patients who cannot have either implants or conventional laboratory - generated fixed prostheses has always been a challenge to clinicians . the development of fiber - reinforced composites ( frcs ) has opened up new possibilities of chairside treatment options to manage these types of clinical situations . techniques using frcs as frameworks with traditional restorative resin composites as veneering materials can provide chairside fixed prostheses that are esthetic and potentially durable , with minimal abutment tooth loss . a clinical case is presented that will illustrate a novel concept for tooth replacement -- the use of an frc prefabricated framework -- to allow for a single visit , chairside replacement of a missing molar . the assembly of the framework and the clinical steps used in the framework placement and pontic fabrication are shown in detail . clinical significance : the combination of frc technology and adhesive techniques can provide minimally invasive and cost - effective treatment options for the chairside replacement of missing posterior teeth .	0
rapid and sensitive analysis of phthalate metabolites , bisphenol a , and endogenous steroid hormones in human urine by mixed - mode solid - phase extraction , dansylation , and ultra - performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry .. steroid hormone levels in human urine are convenient and sensitive indicators for the impact of phthalates and / or bisphenol a ( bpa ) exposure on the human steroid hormone endocrine system . in this study , a rapid and sensitive method for determination of 14 phthalate metabolites , bpa , and ten endogenous steroid hormones in urine was developed and validated on the basis of ultra - performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry . the optimized mixed - mode solid phase - extraction separated the weakly acidic or neutral bpa and steroid hormones from acidic phthalate metabolites in urine : the former were determined in positive ion mode with a methanol / water mobile phase containing 10 mm ammonium formate ; the latter were determined in negative ion mode with a acetonitrile / water mobile phase containing 0 . 1 % acetic acid , which significantly alleviated matrix effects for the analysis of bpa and steroid hormones . dansylation of estrogens and bpa realized simultaneous and sensitive analysis of the endogenous steroid hormones and bpa in a single chromatographic run . the limits of detection were less than 0 . 84 ng / ml for phthalate metabolites and less than 0 . 22 ng / ml for endogenous steroid hormones and bpa . this proposed method had satisfactory precision and accuracy , and was successfully applied to the analyses of human urine samples . this method could be valuable when investigating the associations among endocrine - disrupting chemicals , endogenous steroid hormones , and relevant adverse outcomes in epidemiological studies .	0
effects of bisphenol a ( bpa ) on placentation and survival of the neonates in mice .. the effects of bisphenol a ( bpa ) on placentation have not been fully determined . the aim of this study was to clarify the structural changes of the placenta , abortion rate , and survival of neonates after bpa administration in mice . bpa ( 10 mg / kg / day ) was administered to pregnant mice ( bpa mice ) subcutaneously from the first day of pregnancy ( day 0 ) to day 7 ( 8 days total ). the number of embryos and weights of whole uteri were measured on days 10 and 12 . morphological changes in the placentae were examined by light microscopy on the corresponding days of pregnancy . the number of neonates was also counted . survival rates were periodically calculated for neonates from the first day after parturition ( p - day 0 ) to p - day 56 . the number of embryos and weight of the uterus on days 10 and 12 were significantly decreased by bpa injection . no notable differences were recognized between the left and right uteri . the proportion of the labyrinthine zone per whole placenta in the bpa mice became lower than that in the controls , and that of the metrial gland was higher in the bpa mice . the intervillous spaces of the placenta were narrower in the bpa mice . degenerative changes were found in the trophoblastic giant cells and spongiotrophoblast layers of the bpa mice . the number of bpa mouse neonates was drastically decreased within 3 days after birth , and no mice survived after p - day 56 . the results suggest that bpa not only disrupts placental functions and leads to abortion through chronic stimulation of gene expression by binding to dna but that it also affects the mortality of neonates through indirect exposure of embryos .	0
impact of reaction conditions on the laccase - catalyzed conversion of bisphenol a .. the oxidative conversion of aqueous bpa catalyzed by laccase from trametes versicolor was conducted in a closed , temperature - controlled system containing buffer for ph control . the effects of medium ph , buffer concentration , temperature and mediators and the impacts of dissolved wastewater constituents on bpa conversion were investigated . the optimal ph for bpa conversion was approximately 5 , with greater than half maximal conversion and good enzyme stability in the range of 4 - 7 . the stability of the enzyme was not impacted by buffer concentration , nor was bpa conversion . despite the observation that the enzyme tended to be inactivated at elevated temperatures , enhanced conversion of bpa was observed up until a reaction temperature of 45 degrees c . of the mediators studied , abts was most successful at enhancing the conversion of bpa . dissolved wastewater constituents that were studied included various inorganic salts , organic compounds and heavy metal ions . bpa conversion was inhibited in the presence of anions such as sulfite , thiosulfate , sulfide , nitrite and cyanide . the metal ions fe ( iii ) and cu ( ii ) and the halogens chloride and fluoride substantially suppressed bpa conversion , but the presence of selected organic compounds did not significantly reduce the conversion of bpa .	0
oxidative removal of bisphenol a using zero valent aluminum - acid system .. bisphenol a ( bpa ), a controversial endocrine disruptor , is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment . in this study , the oxidative degradation of bpa and its mechanism using zero valent aluminum ( zval )- acid system under air - equilibrated conditions was investigated . under ph < 3 . 5 acidic conditions , zval demonstrated an excellent capacity to remove bpa . more than 75 % of bpa was eliminated within 12 h in ph 1 . 5 reaction solutions initially containing 4 . 0 g / l aluminum and 2 . 0 mg / l bpa at 25 ± 1 ° c . the removal of bpa was further accelerated with increasing aluminum loadings . higher temperature and lower initial ph also facilitated bpa removal . the addition of fe ( 2 +) into the zval - acid system significantly accelerated the reaction likely due to the enhancing transformation of h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) to ho via fenton reaction . furthermore , the primary products or intermediates including monohydroxylated bpa , hydroquinone , 2 -( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) propane and 4 - isopropenylphenol , were identified and a possible reaction scheme was proposed . the remarkable capacity of the zval - acid system in removing bpa displays its potential application in the treatment of organic compound - contaminated water .	0
endocrine disruptors in bottled mineral water : estrogenic activity in the e - screen .. human exposure to endocrine disruptors is well documented by biomonitoring data . however , this information is limited to few chemicals like bisphenol a or phthalate plasticizers . to account for so - far unidentified endocrine disruptors and potential mixture effects we employ bioassays to detect endocrine activity in foodstuff and consequently characterize the integrated exposure to endocrine active compounds . recently , we reported a broad contamination of commercially available bottled water with estrogenic activity and presented evidence for the plastic packaging being a source of this contamination . in continuation of that work , we here compare different sample preparation methods to extract estrogen - like compounds from bottled water . these data demonstrate that inappropriate extraction methods and sample treatment may lead to false - negative results when testing water extracts in bioassays . using an optimized sample preparation strategy , we furthermore present data on the estrogenic activity of bottled water from france , germany , and italy : eleven of the 18 analyzed water samples ( 61 . 1 %) induced a significant estrogenic response in a bioassay employing a human carcinoma cell line ( mcf7 , e - screen ). the relative proliferative effects ranged from 19 . 8 to 50 . 2 % corresponding to an estrogenic activity of 1 . 9 - 12 . 2 pg estradiol equivalents per liter bottled water . when comparing water of the same spring that is packed in glass or plastic bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ), estrogenic activity is three times higher in water from plastic bottles . these data support the hypothesis that pet packaging materials are a source of estrogen - like compounds . furthermore , the findings presented here conform to previous studies and indicate that the contamination of bottled water with endocrine disruptors is a transnational phenomenon .	0
dna methylation changes in whole blood is associated with exposure to the environmental contaminants , mercury , lead , cadmium and bisphenol a , in women undergoing ovarian stimulation for ivf .. background : changes in dna methylation may play an important role in the deleterious reproductive effects reported in association with exposure to environmental pollutants . in this pilot study , we identify candidate methylation changes associated with exposure to pollutants in women undergoing in vitro fertilization ( ivf ). methods : blood and urine were collected from women on the day of oocyte retrieval . whole blood was analyzed for mercury and lead , and urine for cadmium using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry . unconjugated bisphenol a ( bpa ) was analyzed in serum using high - performance liquid chromatography with coularray detection . participants were dichotomized as higher or lower exposure groups by median concentrations . using the illumina goldengate methylation cancer panel i , dna methylation in whole blood from 43 women was assessed at 1505 cpg sites for association with exposure levels of each pollutant . candidate cpg sites were identified using a diff score >| 13 | ( p < 0 . 05 ) and an absolute difference > 10 % which were confirmed using bisulfite pyrosequencing . results : methylation of the gstm1 / 5 promoter was increased for women with higher mercury exposure ( p = 0 . 04 ); however , no correlation was observed ( r = 0 . 17 , p = 0 . 27 ). reduced methylation was detected in the col1a2 promoter in women with higher exposure to lead ( p = 0 . 004 ), and an inverse correlation was observed ( r = - 0 . 45 , p = 0 . 03 ). lower methylation of a promoter cpg site at the tsp50 gene was detected in women with higher bpa exposure ( p = 0 . 005 ), and again an inverse correlation was identified ( r = - 0 . 51 , p = 0 . 001 ). conclusions : altered dna methylation at various cpg sites was associated with exposure to mercury , lead or bpa , providing candidates to be investigated using a larger study sample , as the results may reflect an independently associated predictor ( e . g . socioeconomic status , diet , genetic variants , altered blood cell composition ). further studies accommodating variations in these factors will be needed to confirm these associations and identify their underlying causes .	0
quantitative determination of bisphenol a from human saliva using bulk derivatization and trap - and - elute liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry .. endocrine disruptors cause adverse health effects as a result of their ability to shift the hormonal balance that is essential to the body . bisphenol a ( bpa ) is an endocrine disruptor that has garnered much attention because of its presence in many consumer materials , which generates a significant risk for exposure . a method is presented for rapid detection of oral exposure to bpa directly from human saliva . saliva was chosen because it serves as a noninvasive sampling route to detect bpa exposure ; however , it is one of many complex biological matrices that have traditionally posed problems in quantitative analysis . such analyses usually require extensive sample preparation to reduce interferences contributed by the sample matrix . three validated methods are presented here that feature a streamlined sample - preparation strategy ( bulk derivatization ) prior to accurate and sensitive analysis by trap - and - elute liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry . validated methods include standard addition calibration with variable injection volumes and multiple injection loading , as well as with incorporation of an internal standard . reported limits of detection reached as low as 49 . 0 pg / ml ( 2 . 9 pg loaded on - column ; equivalent to parts per trillion in saliva ) among the presented methods with good accuracy and precision throughout . a proof - of - concept study is demonstrated to show that the final validated method has potential application to specific studies for trace - level bpa detection from real samples .	0

effect of adhesive thickness on the shear bond strength of scotchbond 2 / silux to dentin .. seventy - five extracted human permanent molars were embedded in brass cups with cold - cure acrylic . immediately prior to the preparation of a test specimen , the occlusal surface was ground wet on 180 followed by 600 grit sic to expose dentin . the scotchprep dentin primer was applied to the dried dentin surface with a brush for 60 seconds , and dried with compressed air for 15 seconds . the tooth was mounted in a special device containing a split teflon mold with a circular hole , 3 . 5 mm in diameter and 5 mm deep , and a : 0 . 5 microl ( 50 microns ), b : 1 . 0 microl ( 100 microns ), c : 2 . 5 microl ( 250 microns ), d : 5 microl ( 500 microns ) or e : 10 microl ( 1000 microns ) scotchbond 2 pipetted into the teflon mold . the adhesive was cured by visible light for 30 seconds . three increments of silux were transferred to the teflon mold , compressed firmly , and each cured for 30 seconds . the test specimens were disassembled 15 minutes after cure and stored in distilled water at 37 degrees c for 24 hours . a shear load was applied via a knife - edge rod in an instron machine . the shear bond strength was expressed in mpa . the data were analyzed by anova and duncan ' s multiple range test . the mean (+/- sd ) of the shear bond strengths were : a : 8 . 8 ( 3 . 5 ), b : 7 . 9 ( 2 . 7 ), c : 6 . 8 ( 2 . 5 ), d : 8 . 1 ( 4 . 2 ), e : 5 . 3 ( 2 . 4 ). adhesive thickness from 50 microns to 500 microns ( a , b , c and d ) had no significantly different effect on shear bond strength . an adhesive thickness of 1000 microns resulted in a significant reduction in shear bond strength .	0
retention and penetration of a conventional resin - based sealant and a photochromatic flowable composite resin placed on occlusal pits and fissures .. this study compares the retention and penetration of a conventional resin - based sealant ( fluroshield ) and a photochromatic flowable composite resin ( tetric flow chroma ) placed on occlusal pits and fissures and submitted to thermal or chemical cycling regimens . penetration assessment -- ten premolars were sealed with each material , isolated ( except for the sealed surface ) and immersed in 0 . 2 % rhodamine b . the teeth were serially sectioned in a mesiodistal direction . the images of the sections were digitized and analyzed ( imagelab ). the distance between the most superficial and the deepest points on the occlusal central groove was calculated to determine the groove ' s total depth . the length of the central groove filled with the sealant was divided by its total depth to obtain the percentage of sealing of the occlusal groove . retention assessment -- 30 premolars were sealed , their occlusal surfaces were photographed and the area occupied by the sealing materials was demarcated ( imagelab ). the teeth were submitted to different treatments : thermocycled , stored in artificial saliva and immersed in acetic acid and saliva ( 10 cycles / day protocol for 30 days ). new photographs were taken to assess the final area occupied by the materials . the difference between the final and initial area was calculated to obtain the material loss . the data was analyzed ( two - way anova and tukey ' s test p < 0 . 05 ). both materials presented similar penetration of the occlusal central groove . after thermal and chemical cycling , the materials did not differ with respect to retention , except for immersion in acetic acid . in this case , tetric flow chroma presented greater retention than fluoroshield .	0
fish bile used to detect estrogenic substances in treated sewage water .. endocrine disrupting effects on fish associated with sewage treatment effluents have been demonstrated in several studies . to investigate if the effluents from two modern swedish sewage treatment plants contained estrogenic substances , juvenile rainbow trout were exposed to sewage water before and after the last treatment step which is a sand filter . as a biomarker for estrogenic effect , vitellogenin was analysed in the blood plasma of the exposed fish . to identify substances possibly responsible for the effect , bile fluid from the exposed fish were analysed with gc / ms . elevated levels of vitellogenin were only seen in the fish exposed at one of the sewage treatment plants , the one with shorter residence time in the biological treatment steps , which suggests that the residence time is of importance for the ability to reduce the amount of estrogenic substances in the sewage water . the highest elevation of vitellogenin was seen in the fish exposed to water before the sand filter , which indicates that the sand filter contributes to further reduction of estrogenic substances in the sewage water . in bile from the same group of fish , considerably higher concentrations of estrone , bisphenol a and 4 - nonylphenol ( 4 . 0 microg / g bile , 23 microg / g bile and 24 microg / g bile , respectively ) were observed compared to bile from control fish (< 0 . 04 microg / g bile , 0 . 21 microg / g bile , and 3 . 5 microg / g bile , respectively ). the more potent steroidal estrogens were suggested to be major contributors to the observed estrogenic effect , although xenoestrogens were detected at higher concentrations in the bile fluid .	0

estrogenic and dioxin - like potency in each step of a controlled landfill leachate treatment plant in japan .. the estrogenic activity ( by e - screen bioassay ), the concentrations of pcbs , pcdds / pcdfs ( and their resulting toxicity equivalents , teq ) and several endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs : e . g ., bisphenol a , nonylphenol , butyl benzylpthalate ( bbp ), di - n - butylphthalate ( dbp ), 17alpha - ethynyl - estradiol or 4 - octylphenol ) have been analyzed from leachates of each step ( before treatment , after biodegradation / sedimentation and after charcoal treatment ) of a controlled landfill leachate treatment plant . the comparison of the effluent of the examined landfill leachate treatment plant with water from a nearby river in this study indicated no additional dioxin - like ( e . g ., teq : 0 . 027 compared to 1 . 01 pg teq / l ; pcbs : 1 . 2 compared to 3 . 9 ng / l ) or estrogenic impact ( 2 . 8 compared to 3 . 5 ng estradiol equivalents ee / l ; analyzed by e - screen bioassay ) from the leachate treatment plant into the surrounding water environment . the impact of dioxin - like compounds from uncleaned leachates into the final cleaned effluents could be sufficiently reduced by the leachate treatment plant for pcdds ( 75 %), pcdfs ( 62 %), dioxin - like pcbs ( 97 %), and the sum of teq ( 78 %). the leachate treatment plant also achieved a reduction of the estrogenic activity as determined by e - screen ( from 4 . 8 to 2 . 8 ng ee / l = 42 %), by gc / ms for bisphenol a (> 96 % and nonylphenol (> 98 %) or by elisa for estradiol (> 80 %). additionally , for the validation of the e - screen , five known endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs : bisphenol a , bbp , dbp , 17 alpha - ethynyl - estradiol , 4 - octylphenol ) were analyzed . the ec50 values and estradiol equivalents factors ( eefs ) for the five edcs determined in this study were comparable to previously published data . the combined biological and chemical trace analysis data have provided valuable information on the relative contribution of natural , synthetic , and non - steroidal anthropogenic chemicals to the estrogenic and dioxin - like activity in leachates from a wastewater treatment plant , and water from a nearby river .	0
bmp7 / actriib regulates estrogen - dependent apoptosis : new biomarkers for environmental estrogens .. a ligand - receptor pair , bone morphogenetic protein - 7 ( bmp7 ) and activin receptor iib ( actriib ), was identified from a pool of dna fragments recovered from mcf7 cells treated with 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) by chromatin immunoprecipitation with antiestrogen receptor - alphaantibody . the e2 responsiveness of both genes was confirmed in mcf cells and in the mouse uterus . repeated treatment with e2 resulted in decreased expression of both actriib and bmp7 mrna in the uteri of ovariectomized mice . a single oral administration of bisphenol a ( bpa ), an environmental estrogen , inhibited actriib and bmp7 expression and apoptosis in the luminal epithelium of the mouse uterus at diestrus ( or early proestrus ). this decrease , due to bpa administration , was restored by an estrogen receptor ( er ) antagonist suggesting that it is mediated through ers . these results suggest that e2 and bpa suppress estrogen - dependent apoptosis of epithelial cells of the endometrium through down - regulation of actriib and bmp7 . thus , we propose that bmp7 and actriib , a ligand - receptor pair , are involved in regulation of the apoptotic signaling pathway and might therefore be new biomarkers of the effects of environmental estrogens on the female reproductive tract .	0

new plastic plates which enhance neurite extension in culture : roles of bisphenol - a and tricyclodecanyl units for growth and orientation of neurites on plastic plates with microstructures .. in order to study molecular mechanisms of contact guidance of neurites , dissociated culture of adult mouse dorsal root ganglion ( drg ) cells was performed for 6 species of plastic plates different in monomer compositions . microstructures ( grooves of 5 - 10 microns wide and 1 micron deep ) were grafted on the plates so as to guide neurite growth in their axial direction . neurites were longer and more oriented on plates with larger water contact angle . the distribution of neurites was uneven between grooves and steps of the microstructures , exhibiting a bell - shaped curve in relation to the water contact angle of the plastic . these indicate that hydrophilic properties of the plastic plate surface , due to the presence of bisphenol - a and tricyclodecanyl units , are crucially involved in the elongation and orientation of neurites .	0
intrauterine bisphenol a exposure leads to stimulatory effects on sertoli cell number in rats .. using the optical disector for quantifying cell numbers , we investigated whether oral treatment of rats on days 6 - 21 of gestation with the weakly estrogenic bisphenol a ( bpa , 0 . 1 or 50 mg / kg ) or the highly estrogenic ethinyl estradiol ( ee , 0 . 02 mg / kg ) alters testicular histology , in those offspring 9 - 12 month of age . since production of male germ cells depends on sertoli cell number , possible changes in that parameter were investigated using unbiased stereology . spermatogenesis was qualitatively normal in all groups . bpa increases sertoli cell number per organ but not when expressed as per gram testis . ee did not affect cell number per organ but did affect numbers on a per gram testis basis due to a lowered testis weight . in contrast to the lowering of sertoli cell numbers that might have been expected according to the estrogen hypothesis , intrauterine administration of these xenoestrogens in fact resulted in minor increases in sertoli cell numbers and had no qualitative effect on spermatogenesis .	0
in vitro caries - preventive effect of fluoridated orthodontic resins against cariogenic challenge stimulation .. aim : the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro caries preventive effect of fluoridated orthodontic resins under ph cycling with two types of acid demineralizing saliva . materials and methods : brackets were bonded to 120 extracted human premolars , using rely - a - bond ( n = 40 ), tru - bond ( n = 40 ) and ortho - one ( n = 40 ) orthodontic bonding agents . each group of resin was divided into 2 subgroups ( n = 20 ): immersion in remineralizing artificial saliva for 14 days and acid saliva with ph 4 . 3 . after 14 days of ph cycling the caries preventive effect on the development of white spot lesion was evaluated considering the presence of inhibition zones to white spot lesions using two scores : 0 = absence and 1 = presence . kruskal - wallis anova and mann - whitney u tests were used . results : formation of white spot lesions was observed only under ph cycling using acid saliva with ph 4 . 3 ; with rely - a - bond and tru - bond being significantly more effective in preventing the appearance of white spot lesions effect than ortho - one . conclusion : the acidity of the demineralizing solution influenced the formation of white spot lesions around orthodontic brackets under highly cariogenic conditions . rely - a - bond and tru - bond presented higher caries - preventive effect than orthoone . clinical significance : the development of fluoride - containing materials cannot be regarded as a permanent means to control dental caries lesions , but a complement along with other preventive methods .	0
direct bonding brackets : unfilled versus unfilled / filled resins .. the clinical and clinical / laboratorial performance of unfilled / filled and only unfilled resins for direct bonding of orthodontic brackets were evaluated . in the clinical part , brackets were bonded using both techniques in alternate quadrants of eleven patients of the orthodontic clinic , state university of rio de janeiro . a total of 118 teeth , 59 in each group , were tested and bond failure frequencies were recorded for six months . for the clinical / laboratory part , upper and lower premolars to be extracted for orthodontic reasons , were selected . thirty - two brackets were bonded in vivo -- 16 using unfilled / filled and 16 using only unfilled resins -- and the teeth were kept in the mouth for two months . after extraction , the teeth were secured in plastic rings and an universal instron machine was used to debond the brackets . no statistically significant differences were observed for clinical failure rates , nor for laboratory debonding strength between the two techniques . failures occurred preponderantly at the bracket / resin interface , so that most of the resin remained bonded to the enamel surface on both groups .	0

the effect of different curing time regimens on immediate postpolymerization color changes of resin composites .. aim : light curing of resin composites may considerably change the color of resin composites . the aim of this study was to evaluate the changing pattern of resin composite ' s color by different curing times . materials and methods : fifteen , 1 mm - thick , samples of each a2 shade clearfill and filtek p60 composites were prepared . first five samples were cured for 10s ( 400 mw / cm2 ) in each pole of the rectangular samples ( right upper , right lower , left lower , left upper plus central zone ). consecutive sets of samples , each consists of five , were irradiated by doubling and tripling the curing time to 20 and 30s . color change were measured by means of cie 1976 l * a * b system equation ( δe ) for each digitalized picture of the corresponding sample . results : color of samples was clinically significant changed by increasing the curing time from 10 to 20s and from 20 to 30s for clearfil ( δe = 13 . 86 and 14 . 11 respectively ,) and filtek p60 ( δe = 7 . 68 and 11 . 66 respectively ). the ' b ' component change was responsible for the most color alteration confirmed by the linear regression model ( p < 0 . 001 ). conclusion : this study revealed the contrasting pattern of resin composite ' s color change with the different curing times . our findings support that light curing is accompanied by a higher attained blue chroma and diminished yellowness of resin composites . clinical significance : a complete and proper curing of sample resin composites on buccal surface of particular tooth , as a common practice to ensure the maximize concordance composite and tooth color , is reassured according to the considerable differences of undercured and overcured in comparison to normocured composite .	0
comparative analysis for selection of resin luting cements based on filler content : an in vitro study .. context : resin luting of all - ceramic restorations results in increased performance ; however , the strengthening mechanism and the role of the mechanical properties of the resin are not fully understood . objective : the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of filler content on the flexural properties of resin luting agents and thereby selecting an appropriate resin luting cement . materials and methods : three esthetic resin luting agents studied were calibra ( dentsply ); relyx arc and panavia f . ten beam - shaped specimen ( l * w * h : 30 * 8 * 2 mm ) were made for each of the material tests carried out . the specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 hours at 37 ° c . the specimens were then tested for flexural strength ( mpa ) and flexural modulus ( gpa ) using the three - point bending method on a universal material testing machine at a cross head speed of 0 . 5 mm / min . data obtained were statistically analyzed using anova followed by post - hoc - tukey ' s test with p < 0 . 05 for statistical significance . results : increase in mean strength related to an associated increase in the elastic modulus which in turn was related to the filler loading of the resin luting cements . conclusion : strength and performance of resin - cemented allceramic restoration can be enhanced by the use of a resin luting cement having increased filler content . clinical implications : resin - composite cements may be most suitable for adhesively bonded restorations , where margins are placed on supragingival enamel , and where ultimate strength and energy absorption are paramount . the selection criteria for a resin cement depends on its flexural strength . to a great extent , the flexural strength is dependent on the filler loading of the resin luting cement .	0
widespread occurrence of bisphenol a in paper and paper products : implications for human exposure .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is used in a variety of consumer products , including some paper products , particularly thermal receipt papers , for which it is used as a color developer . nevertheless , little is known about the magnitude of bpa contamination or human exposure to bpa as a result of contact with paper and paper products . in this study , concentrations of bpa were determined in 15 types of paper products ( n = 202 ), including thermal receipts , flyers , magazines , tickets , mailing envelopes , newspapers , food contact papers , food cartons , airplane boarding passes , luggage tags , printing papers , business cards , napkins , paper towels , and toilet paper , collected from several cities in the usa . thermal receipt papers also were collected from japan , korea , and vietnam . bpa was found in 94 % of thermal receipt papers ( n = 103 ) at concentrations ranging from below the limit of quantitation ( loq , 1 ng / g ) to 13 . 9 mg / g ( geometric mean : 0 . 211 mg / g ). the majority ( 81 %) of other paper products ( n = 99 ) contained bpa at concentrations ranging from below the loq to 14 . 4 μg / g ( geometric mean : 0 . 016 μg / g ). whereas thermal receipt papers contained the highest concentrations of bpa ( milligram - per - gram ), some paper products , including napkins and toilet paper , made from recycled papers contained microgram - per - gram concentrations of bpa . contamination during the paper recycling process is a source of bpa in paper products . daily intake ( di ) of bpa through dermal absorption was estimated based on the measured bpa concentrations and handling frequency of paper products . the daily intake of bpa ( calculated from median concentrations ) through dermal absorption from handling of papers was 17 . 5 and 1300 ng / day for the general population and occupationally exposed individuals , respectively ; these values are minor compared with exposure through diet . among paper products , thermal receipt papers contributed to the majority (> 98 %) of the exposures .	0
effect of ethanol - wet bonding with hydrophobic adhesive on caries - affected dentine .. frequently encountered in clinical practice , caries - affected dentine ( cad ) is the most challenging bonding substrate . this study evaluated the effect of ethanol - wet bonding with hydrophobic adhesive to sound dentine and to cad . in the control groups , prepared sound dentine and cad were bonded with adper single bond 2 using a traditional water - wet bonding technique . in the experimental groups , the specimens were treated as follows : group 1 , rinsed with stepwise ethanol dehydration ; group 2 , immersion in 100 % ethanol , three times , for 20 s each time ; and group 3 , immersion in 100 % ethanol for 20 s . microtensile bond strength ( μtbs ) testing was used to evaluate the effects of the different protocols on bonding . the microhardness of debonded dentine surfaces was measured to ensure the presence of cad . interfacial nanoleakage was evaluated by field - emission scanning electron microscopy . treatment significantly improved the μtbs in cad in groups 1 and 2 , but had no effect on group 3 . conversely , treatment significantly reduced the μtbs in sound dentine in groups 2 and 3 , but had no effect in group 1 . the presence of nanoleakage varied with the ethanol - wet protocol used . in conclusion , ethanol - wet bonding can potentially improve bond efficacy to cad when an appropriate protocol is used .	0
effect of operator variability on dentin bond strength of two - step bonding systems .. purpose : to examine the influence of operator variability on adhesion to dentin of recently developed two - step bonding systems . materials and methods : a self - etching primer system , fluoro bond / lite - fil ii a ( fb ) and a one - bottle adhesive system , single bond / z100 ( sb ) were employed . three groups , each consisting of 15 operators , were selected from the dentists at the university ( group 1 ), undergraduate students ( group 2 ), and general practitioners ( group 3 ). labial surfaces of extracted bovine teeth were ground on wet 600 - grit sic paper and then washed and dried with oil - free compressed air . these surfaces were treated according to each adhesive system ' s instructions and the restorative resins were condensed into a teflon mold ( 2 mm height , 4 mm internal diameter ) and then light - cured . the finished specimens were stored in 37 degrees c distilled water for 1 hr . these specimens were tested in a shear mode at a cross - head speed of 1 . 0 mm / min . the mean and standard deviation were subjected to two - way anova ( p < 0 . 05 ). results : significant differences in bond strength of the two adhesives were found within each operator group . a wider variation in bond strength was seen for sb compared to fb for the three different groups . mean bond strengths for the faculty group were statistically greater than those of the other two groups , which did not differ significantly . even though the specimen preparation was done under in vitro conditions , the large coefficients of variation indicate it may be difficult to create suitable surface conditions for optimal bonding .	0
molecular level understanding of adhesion mechanisms at the epoxy / polymer interfaces .. it is important to understand the buried interfacial structures containing epoxy underfills as such structures determine the interfacial adhesion properties . weak adhesion or delamination at such interfaces leads to failure of microelectronic devices . sum frequency generation ( sfg ) vibrational spectroscopy was used to examine buried interfaces at polymer / model epoxy and polymer / commercial epoxy resins ( used as underfills in flip chip devices ) at the molecular level . we investigated a model epoxy : bisphenol a digylcidyl ether ( badge ) at the interfaces of poly ( ethylene terephthalate ) ( pet ) before and after curing . furthermore , small amounts of different silanes including ( 3 - glycidoxypropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( γ - gps ), ( 3 - aminopropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( atms ), octadecyltrimethoxysilane ( otms ( 18c )), and octyltrimethoxysilane ( otms ( 8c )) were mixed with badge . silane influences on the polymer / epoxy interfacial structures were studied . sfg was also used to study molecular interfacial structures between polymers and two commercial epoxy resins . the interfacial structures probed by sfg were correlated to the adhesion strengths measured for corresponding interfaces . the results indicated that a small amount of silane molecules added to epoxy could substantially change the polymer / epoxy interfacial structure , greatly affecting the adhesion strength at the interface . it was found that ordered methyl groups at the interface lead to weak adhesion , and disordered interfaces lead to strong adhesion .	0
estrogen receptor - ligand complexes measured by chip - based nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry : an approach for the screening of endocrine disruptors .. in the present report , a method based on chip - based nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry ( nanoesi - ms ) is described to detect noncovalent ligand binding to the human estrogen receptor alpha ligand - binding domain ( heralpha lbd ). this system represents an important environmental interest , because a wide variety of molecules , known as endocrine disruptors , can bind to the estrogen receptor ( er ) and induce adverse health effects in wildlife and humans . using proper experimental conditions , the nanoesi - ms approach allowed for the detection of specific ligand interactions with heralpha lbd . the relative gas - phase stability of selected heralpha lbd - ligand complexes did not mirror the binding affinity in solution , a result that demonstrates the prominent role of hydrophobic contacts for stabilizing er - ligand complexes in solution . the best approach to evaluate relative solution - binding affinity by nanoesi - ms was to perform competitive binding experiments with 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) used as a reference ligand . among the ligands tested , the relative binding affinity for heralpha lbd measured by nanoesi - ms was 4 - hydroxtamoxifen approximately diethylstilbestrol > e2 > genistein > bisphenol a , consistent with the order of the binding affinities in solution . the limited reproducibility of the bound to free protein ratio measured by nanoesi - ms for this system only allowed the binding constants ( k ( d )) to be estimated ( low nanomolar range for e2 ). the specificity of nanoesi - ms combined with its speed ( 1 min / ligand ), low sample consumption ( 90 pmol protein / ligand ), and its sensitivity for ligand ( 30 ng / ml ) demonstrates that this technique is a promising method for screening suspected endocrine disrupting compounds and to qualitatively evaluate their binding affinity .	0
uniformly sized molecularly imprinted polymers for bisphenol a and beta - estradiol : retention and molecular recognition properties in hydro - organic mobile phases .. uniformly sized molecularly imprinted polymers ( mips ) for bisphenol a ( bpa ) have been prepared using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( edma ) as a cross - linker and methacrylic acid , 2 - diethylaminoethyl methacrylate or 4 - vinylpyridine ( 4 - vpy ) as a functional monomer or without use of a functional monomer . the mips obtained for bpa were evaluated using a mixture of phosphate buffer ( or water ) and acetonitrile or only acetonitrile as the mobile phase . among the mips prepared , that using 4 - vpy showed the highest retentivity and selectivity for bpa . the highest selectivity factor , which is defined as the ratio of the retention factors ( k ) on the molecularly imprinted and non - imprinted polymers , k ( imprinted )/ k ( non - imprinted ), was 9 . 4 for bpa on the bpa - imprinted 4 - vpy - co - edma polymers , while that for beta - estradiol on the beta - estradiol - imprinted 4 - vpy - co - edma polymers was 2 . 4 . the differences in the selectivity factors between bpa and beta - estradiol on the respective mips could be ascribable to differences in the number of interaction sites . it is plausible that the phenol groups of bpa could interact with two pyridyl groups of the mip by hydrogen bonding interactions , while there is only one such site for beta - estradiol . furthermore , the results suggest that hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions can play an important role in the retention and recognition of bpa and beta - estradiol in the hydro - organic mobile phase , while hydrogen bonding interactions seem to be useful for the retention and recognition when acetonitrile is used as the mobile phase .	0
tensile bond strength of filled and unfilled adhesives to dentin .. purpose : to determine the tensile bond strength of three filled and two unfilled adhesives applied to bovine dentin . materials and methods : fragments of the labial dentin of bovine incisors were embedded in pvc cylinders with self - cure acrylic resin , and ground flat using 200 grit and 600 grit sandpaper . the following adhesive systems were tested ( n = 10 ): prime & bond nt , prime & bond nt dual cure , prime & bond 2 . 1 , optibond solo and single bond . a 3 mm - diameter bonding surface was delimited using a perforated adhesive tape . after etching with 37 % phosphoric acid and adhesive application , a resin - based composite truncated cone ( tph , shade a3 ) was built . tensile test was performed after 24 hrs storage in distilled water at 37 degrees c . failure mode was accessed using a x10 magnification stereomicroscope . results : weibull statistical analysis revealed significant differences in the characteristic strength between single bond and prime & bond nt dual cure , and between single bond and prime & bond 2 . 1 . the weibull parameter ( m ) was statistically similar among the five groups . single bond and prime & bond nt showed areas of dentin cohesive failure in most of the specimens . for optibond solo , prime & bond nt dual cure and prime & bond 2 . 1 failure was predominantly adhesive .	0
pulp response to direct capping with an adhesive system .. purpose : to evaluate the pulp response following direct pulp capping with an adhesive system ( prime & bond 2 . 0 - pb 2 . 0 ) and a zinc - oxide eugenol cement ( zoe ) on pulp exposures in rat molar teeth . materials and methods : forty - eight class i cavities were prepared on the occlusal surface of molar teeth of rats ( rattus norvegicus , holtzman ). pulp exposures performed on the cavity floor were capped either with the adhesive system p & b 2 . 0 or zoe . after 7 , 15 , 30 , and 60 days , the specimens were processed through h & e and brown & brenn staining techniques . results : both pulp capping materials allowed pulp repair , characterized by reorganization of a new odontoblast cell layer underlying the dentin bridge formation . however , p & b 2 . 0 promoted a large zone of cell - rich fibrodentin matrix deposition between the pulp capping material and the dentin bridge , which was deposited far from the pulp exposure site . on the other hand , pulps capped with zoe showed dentin bridging immediately subjacent to the pulp capping material . in those samples in which microleakage occurred between dental material and cavity walls there was a persistent inflammatory reaction and lack of complete pulp repair .	0
a comparison of the adhesion of three restorative materials .. unlabelled : this study compared the adhesion of three different composite restoration resins . for this investigation , 45 extracted lower wisdom molars were selected and 45 class i cavities were prepared by the same operator , and were randomly divided into three groups of 15 samples each . group a : the molars of this group were filled with surefil and the adhesive used was prime & bond nt . group b : the molars of this group were filled with prodigy condensable and the adhesive used was optibond solo . group c : for the molars of this group , enamel plus was used as composite and prime & bond nt was used as adhesive . as a negative control , twenty teeth were used without class i preparations . teeth were embedded in cold - cure acrylic resin and sectioned longitudinally . dye penetration at the enamel and dentin margins were scored at 30 x magnification . evaluations were rated from 0 to 3 ( 0 = no leakage ; 1 = dye penetration up to one - half of the preparation depth ; 2 = dye penetration more than one - half of preparation depth , but less than the axial wall ; 3 = dye penetration along the axial wall ). all the samples were analyzed with sem at the following magnifications : 80 x ( i micrograph ), 220 and 740 x ( ii micrograph ), 1200 x and 4200 x ( iii micrograph ). the samples of groups b and c showed no dye penetration . the samples of group a showed either a level 2 or a level 3 dye penetration .	0
marginal leakage of filled dentin adhesives used with wet and dry bonding techniques .. purpose : to evaluate the effect of wet and dry bonding on microleakage of class v restorations bonded with three filled bonding agents . materials and methods : sixty extracted human premolar and molar teeth were randomly assigned to five groups for bonding with optibond solo , permaquick pqi , prime & bond nt ( one coat ), prime & bond nt ( two coats ) and prime & bond 2 . 1 , as a control material . cavities were cut in both the buccal and lingual surfaces . half of each preparation was in enamel and the other was in cementum / dentin . the cavities were restored with resin - based composite after the application of dentin bonding agents using a wet and dry technique for each material . the teeth were stored in distilled water for 6 days at 37 degrees c , thermocycled , and the restorations examined microscopically for leakage using procion brilliant red as a marker . results : all groups showed microleakage at both the enamel and dentin margins . at the gingival margin , there was a significant difference between the groups for wet bonding ( p = 0 . 0349 ) but not for dry bonding ( p = 0 . 9983 ) ( kruskal - wallis test ). there was no significant difference between the groups at the enamel margin ( wet bonding : p = 0 . 9999 , dry - bonding : p = 0 . 9304 ) ( kruskal - wallis test ). the wet - bonding technique was compared with the dry - bonding technique for each material at both the gingival and enamel margins and no significant differences were observed ( in all cases p > 0 . 5 ) ( mann - whitney u - test ).	0
bisphenol a blood and saliva levels prior to and after dental sealant placement in adults .. purpose : this study examined the effects of a widely used ( delton pit & fissure sealant - light cure opaque , dentsply professional , york , pa ) pit and fissure sealant material on bisphenol a ( bpa ) levels in blood and saliva , among both low and high - dose groups over time . methods : a convenience sample of 30 adults from the old dominion university population were randomly and evenly divided into 2 independent variable groups : a low - dose group ( 1 occlusal sealant application ) and high - dose group ( 4 occlusal sealant applications ). a 2 group , time series design was used to examine the presence and concentration of bpa in serum and saliva after sealant placement . differences comparing low - dose and high - dose groups were examined 1 hour prior ( baseline ), 1 hour post , 3 hours post and 24 hours after sealant placement , as measured by a direct - competitive bpa enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ). hypothesized outcomes were evaluated by applying a parametric , 2 way anova for repeated measures technique to data on the 30 participants ranging in age from 18 to 40 years , and were of mixed gender and ethnicity . results : bpa was detected in the saliva of all participants prior to sealant placement and ranged from 0 . 07 to 6 . 00 ng / ml at baseline . salivary bpa concentration levels peaked over a 3 hour period following sealant placement and returned to baseline levels within 24 hours . bpa was significantly elevated at all post - sealant placement time periods for both the low - dose ( 1 occlusal sealant application ) and high - dose ( 4 occlusal sealant applications ) groups with peak levels of 3 . 98 ng / ml and 9 . 08 ng / ml , respectively . the blood serum did not contain bpa at any point in this investigation . conclusions : exposure to bpa from sources other than dental resins contributes to salivary baseline concentration levels and indicates environmental exposure and use of products containing bpa . use of specific molecular formulations of dental sealant material determines the release of bpa , therefore , dental sealant materials should be reviewed independently when questioning the release of bpa from dental sealants . in addition , dosage amounts of the dental sealant material used in this study do not influence the serum concentration levels of bpa . further research is needed to examine the cumulative estrogenic effects of bpa from dental sealants .	0
in vitro orthodontic bracket bonding to porcelain .. this in vitro study investigated the influence of using different combinations of bracket , adhesive , and light - curing source on the tensile bond strength to porcelain and on failure patterns at debonding . tensile tests were performed using : one ceramic bracket versus one metal bracket , two orthodontic composites ; type bisphenol a - glycidyldimethacrylate and urethane dimethacrylate ( udma ), and four light - curing units with the same range of emission spectrum but various light intensities : three light - emitting diode ( led ) units and one halogen - based unit . one hundred and sixty porcelain samples were randomly divided into 16 equal groups . the porcelain surface was conditioned with 9 per cent hydrofluoric acid before silane application . the composite was photo - polymerized for 40 seconds . after storage in water at 37 ° c for 24 hours , the samples were subjected to tensile force until bond failure . bond strength and bond failure mode were recorded ; results were analysed ( α = 0 . 05 ) using r language ; linear model with constant variance for the bond strength and multinomial distribution for the failure mode . the bond strength in all groups was sufficient to withstand orthodontic treatment (> 6 mpa ). there was no statistical difference between the adhesives , but comparing bracket × light interaction , it was significantly higher with the ceramic bracket . no significant differences were seen between the metal bracket groups , but for the ceramic bracket , the results were significantly higher with the led light . no fracture was observed in porcelain with the metal bracket but it occurred in 35 per cent of the ceramic bracket samples and the risk was higher when using udma composite and lower with led high intensity light .	0
products of aqueous chlorination of bisphenol a and their estrogenic activity .. to assess the estrogenic activity potentially stemming from bisphenol a ( bpa ) in drinking water , apci / lc / ms and nmr were used to identify the products of its aqueous chlorination under the following conditions : 500 microg / l bisphenol a and 1 . 46 mg / l sodium hypochlorite ( ph 7 . 5 ) at 25 degrees c . the 13 products ( 4 - chloro - bpa ; 2 , 6 '- dichloro - bpa ; 2 , 6 - dichloro - bpa ; 2 , 2 ', 6 '- trichloro - bpa ; 2 , 2 ', 6 , 6 '- tetrachloro - bpa ; trichlorophenol ; 4 - isopropyl - 2 '- hydroxylphenol ; and six kinds of polychlorinated phenoxyphenols ( pcpps )) were found in the chlorinated bpa solution . three main pathways are proposed : ( 1 ) chlorine - substitution reactions on the aromatic ring , followed by dehydration to form the chlorine - substituted bpa , ( 2 ) chlorine substitution reactions followed by cleavage of the alpha - c on the isopropyl moiety with positive partial charge and beta '- c on the benzene moiety with a negative partial charge to form trichlorophenol and 4 - isopropyl - 2 '- hydroxylphenol , and ( 3 ) the formation of pcpps . especially for pathway 2 , the reaction mechanism was clarified based on semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations . the reaction proceeded by attack of the oh and cl ( from hocl ) on the alpha - c on the isopropyl moiety with a positive partial charge and on the beta '- c with a negative partial charge on the benzene moiety . the activation energies forthe hocl / 4 - chloro - bpa and 2 , 2 ', 6 , 6 '- tetrachloro - bpa reactions were 0 . 14 and 0 . 15 kcal / mol , respectively . finally , the estrogenic activity of the aqueous chlorinated bpa solution was assessed by an estrogen receptor binding assay and a yeast two - hybrid system . it was found that the binding affinity of the chlorinated aqueous bpa at 60 min was 24 times that before chlorination . the transcriptional activation - induced by products were detected by a yeast two - hybrid system based on the ligand - dependent interaction of two proteins , a human er and a coactivator , suggesting that the chlorinated bpa solution elicits an ability to mimic the effect of the estrogen hormone .	0
effects of flowable resin on bond strength and gap formation in class i restorations .. objectives : this study measured resin / dentin bond strengths and evaluated gap formation at the pulpal floor of occlusal composite restorations using a flowable resin as a liner with either bulk or incremental placement of the restorative composite . methods : class i occlusal preparations were made in 16 extracted molars , and were randomly divided into two groups for restoration using either one - step adhesive ( os , bisco ) and renew composite ( rw , bisco ) or optibond solo adhesive ( solo , kerr ) and herculite xrv composite ( xrv , kerr ). a flowable resin [ aeliteflo ( ae , bisco ) or revolution ( rv , kerr )] was applied as a liner in half of the specimens of each group . the lined and unlined groups were restored with composite cured in bulk , or cured in 1 . 5 mm increments . after 24 h in water , the teeth were sectioned into 0 . 7 - mm thick slabs and were examined with an optical microscope ( 400 x ) to determine the presence of internal resin - dentin gaps . the gap - free specimens were trimmed and were subjected to microtensile bond strength testing . specimens that contained gaps had knoop hardness of the restorative material measured . results : all incrementally filled restorations were well adapted to the pulpal floor but nearly all bulk - cured specimens had gaps between the flowable and the hybrid composites . the use of a flowable resin increased the bond strength of os , but not solo . significance : the incremental technique prevented gap formation regardless of the use of a flowable resin . in contrast , the use of a flowable composite did not guarantee gap - free restorations or improved bond strength of resin to dentin in bulk - filled restorations .	0
compomers -- a new bracket bonding generation in orthodontics ?. compomers are a new class of materials . with the compomer dyract ortho ., specifically for bracket bonding , and with prime & bond 2 . 0 , a one - component primer for enamel and dentin , detrey / dentsply has developed alternative new materials . the aim of this in vitro study was to test the tensile bonding strength of these materials with different kinds of brackets . twelve test groups , each with 30 prepared bovine incisors , were formed . two primers , prime & bond 2 . 0 and psa , were used . 50 % of all teeth were first etched will 36 % phosphoric acid . three types of brackets -- metal , ceramic and silan ceramic -- were bonded with the compomer dyract ortho . for 90 teeth forming a control group , the composite concise was used . when conditioning the enamel with 36 % phosphoric acid , the compomer dyract ortho showed a similar tensile bonding strength to the composite concise . this was not the case if metal brackets were used . metal brackets had significantly less tensile bonding strength ( p < 0 . 001 ). the interface of the compomer with the bracket was the main failure site . there was insufficient retention between the compomer and the foil mesh of the bracket base because of the strong consistency of the compomer . without enamel etching , dyract ortho produced an acceptable result only in combination with the primer prime & bond 2 . 0 and silan ceramic brackets . as insufficient data are available to date , the use of compomers in clinical practice cannot yet be recommended .	0

development of a multi - residue method for the determination of organic micropollutants in water , sediment and mussels using gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry .. this study describes the development of a multiresidue method based on gas chromatography - electron ionization - tandem mass spectrometry ( gc - ei - ms / ms ) for the detection of sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ), five phthalate esters ( pes ), seven polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ), six polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( pbdes ), six alkylphenols ( aps ), three organochlorined pesticides and their isomers or degradation products ( ocps ) and bisphenol a in seawater , river water , wastewater treatment plant ( wwtp ) effluents , sediments and mussels . solid phase extraction ( spe ) was used for the extraction of target analytes in aqueous samples , and ultrasound assisted extraction for solid samples . gc - ei - ms / ms acquisition conditions in selected reaction monitoring ( srm ) using two transitions per compound were optimized . in this way , quantification and unequivocal identification of organic micropollutants were performed in compliance with the decision 2002 / 657 / ec . good linearity responses with coefficients of determination higher than 0 . 99 were obtained . methodological detection limits ( mdls ) in seawater ranged from 0 . 1 to 6 ng l (- 1 ); in river water from 0 . 1 to 4 . 8 ng l (- 1 ); in wwtp effluents from 1 to 75 ng l (- 1 ); in sediments from 1 to 150 ng g (- 1 ) and in mussels from 1 to 125 ng g (- 1 ). mdls and recovery yields were compared with other published methods and similarities or even improvements were achieved . the optimized method was applied to analyze five samples from each matrix collected in coastal areas , showing its potential use for marine pollution monitoring .	0
mining of biomarker genes from expressed sequence tags and differential display reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction in the self - fertilizing fish , kryptolebias marmoratus and their expression patterns in response to exposure to an endocrine - disrupting alkylphenol , bisphenol a .. expressed sequence tags ( ests ) and differentially expressed cdnas from the self - fertilizing fish , kryptolebias marmoratus were mined to develop alternative biomarkers for endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ). 1 , 577 k . marmoratus cdna clones were randomly sequenced from the 5 '- end . these clones corresponded to 1 , 518 and 1 , 519 genes in medaka dbest and zebrafish dbest , respectively . of the matched genes , 197 and 115 genes obtained unigene ids in medaka dbest and zebrafish dbest , respectively . many of the annotated genes are potential biomarkers for environmental stresses . in a differential display reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( dd rt - pcr ) study , 56 differential expressed genes were obtained from fish liver exposed to bisphenol a . of these , 16 genes were identified after blast search to genbank , and the annotated genes were mainly involved in catalytic activity and binding . the expression patterns of these 16 genes were validated by real - time rt - pcr of liver tissue from fish exposed to bisphenol a . our findings suggest that expression of these 16 genes is modulated by endocrine disrupting chemicals , and therefore that they are potential biomarkers for environmental stress including edcs exposure .	0
endocrine regulation of hox genes .. hox genes have a well - characterized role in embryonic development , where they determine identity along the anteroposterior body axis . hox genes are expressed not only during embryogenesis but also in the adult , where they are necessary for functional differentiation . despite the known function of these genes as transcription factors , few regulatory mechanisms that drive hox expression are known . recently , several hormones and their cognate receptors have been shown to regulate hox gene expression and thereby mediate development in the embryo as well as functional differentiation in the adult organism . estradiol , progesterone , testosterone , retinoic acid , and vitamin d have been shown to regulate hox gene expression . in the embryo , the endocrine system directs axial hox gene expression ; aberrant hox gene expression due to exposure to endocrine disruptors contributes to the teratogenicity of these compounds . in the adult , endocrine regulation of hox genes is necessary to enable such diverse functions as hematopoiesis and reproduction ; endocrinopathies can result in dysregulated hox gene expression affecting physiology . by regulating hox genes , hormonal signals utilize a conserved mechanism that allows generation of structural and functional diversity in both developing and adult tissues . this review discusses endocrine hox regulation and its impact on physiology and human pathology .	0
estrogen and environmental estrogenic chemicals exert developmental effects on rat hypothalamic neurons and glias .. we investigated effects of 17beta - estradiol ( e ( 2 )) and endocrine disrupters , nonylphenol ( np ) and bisphenol - a ( bpa ), focusing on the neuronal development in cultures of fetal rat hypothalamic cells . we applied different concentrations of e ( 2 ), np or bpa to the cultured hypothalamic cells and observed their effects on dendritic and synaptic development by immunocytochemistry using anti - microtubule associated protein - 2 ( map2 ) and anti - synapsin i antibodies , respectively . administration of e ( 2 ) for 7 days affected map2 - positive area as well as synapsin i - positive area . np and bpa also influenced neuronal developments . the significant increase both in map2 - and synapsin i - positive areas was observed at 10 and / or 100 nm of them , while 1 microm of them reduced the positive areas . synaptic densities calculated from synapsin i - positive area / map2 - positive area were not constant among different doses of three chemicals , but increased at 10 and / or 100 nm and decreased at 1 microm . furthermore , immunostaining of np - treated cells with the antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) revealed that glial development was similarly influenced by np . therefore , the present results demonstrated that not only e ( 2 ) but also the environmental estrogenic chemicals , np and bpa , affect development of fetal rat hypothalamic cells in vitro .	0
potentiometric sensor for determination of neutral bisphenol a using a molecularly imprinted polymer as a receptor .. the aim of this paper is to develop a potentiometric sensing methodology for sensitive and selective determination of neutral phenols by using a molecularly imprinted polymer as a receptor . bisphenol a ( bpa ), a significant environmental contaminant , is employed as the model target . the bpa - imprinted polymer is synthesized by the semi - covalent technique and incorporated into a plasticized poly ( vinyl chloride ) membrane doped with the tridodecylmethylammonium salt . the present electrode shows a linear anionic potential response over the concentration range from 0 . 1 to 1 μm with a detection limit of 0 . 02 μm , and exhibits an excellent selectivity over other phenols . the proposed approach has been successfully applied to the determination of bpa released from real plastic samples . it offers promising potential in development of potentiometric sensors for measuring neutral phenols at trace levels .	0
in vitro estrogenicity of polybrominated diphenyl ethers , hydroxylated pdbes , and polybrominated bisphenol a compounds .. polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( pbdes ) are used in large quantities as additive flame retardants in plastics and textile materials . pbdes are persistent compounds and have been detected in wildlife and in human adipose tissue and plasma samples . in this study , we investigated the ( anti ) estrogenic potencies of several pbde congeners , three hydroxylated pbdes ( ho - pbdes ), and differently brominated bisphenol a compounds in three different cell line assays based on estrogen receptor ( er )- dependent luciferase reporter gene expression . in human t47d breast cancer cells stably transfected with an estrogen - responsive luciferase reporter gene construct ( peretata - luc ), 11 pbdes showed estrogenic potencies , with concentrations leading to 50 % induction ( ec ( 50 )) varying from 2 . 5 to 7 . 3 microm . the luciferase induction of the most potent ho - pbde [ 2 - bromo - 4 -( 2 , 4 , 6 - tribromophenoxy ) phenol ] exceeded that of estradiol ( e ( 2 )), though at concentrations 50 , 000 times higher . as expected , brominated bisphenol a compounds with the lowest degree of bromination showed highest estrogenic potencies ( ec ( 50 ) values of 0 . 5 microm for 3 - monobromobisphenol a ). in an er alpha - specific , stably transfected human embryonic kidney cell line ( 293 - er alpha - luc ), the ho - pbde 4 -( 2 , 4 , 6 - tribromophenoxy ) phenol was a highly potent estrogen with an ec ( 50 ) < 0 . 1 microm and a maximum 35 - to 40 - fold induction , which was similar to e ( 2 ). in an analogous er beta - specific 293 - er betas - luc cell line , the agonistic potency of the 4 -( 2 , 4 , 6 - tribromophenoxy ) phenol was much lower ( maximum 50 % induction compared to e ( 2 )), but ec ( 50 ) values were comparable . these results indicate that several pure pbde congeners , but especially ho - pbdes and brominated bisphenol a - analogs , are agonists of both er alpha and er beta receptors , thus stimulating er - mediated luciferase induction in vitro . these data also suggest that in vivo metabolism of pbdes may produce more potent pseudoestrogens .	0
insufficient cure under the condition of high irradiance and short irradiation time .. objectives : to investigate if and why a plasma arc curing ( pac ) light tends to undercure methacrylate - based resins or resin composites . methods : model dimethacrylate resins , commercial dental adhesives , and commercial resin composites were cured using a pac light and a halogen light with the similar radiant exposures but different combinations of irradiance and irradiation time . the degree of double bond conversion ( dc ) was measured with ftir spectroscopy and analyzed as a function of radiant exposure . results : the pac light produced a lower dc than the halogen light for the model resin with the lowest viscosity and for three of the four adhesives . with a high irradiance , the pac light could cure three of the four composites as thoroughly as its halogen counterpart . when the irradiance was reduced , however , three composites yielded a lower dc . conclusions : insufficient cure by pac lights or any curing lights with very high irradiance is likely to happen when too short an irradiation time is used . it is because under higher irradiance , the lifetime of free radicals is shorter .	0

comparison of serum vitellogenin , steroid hormone , gonad histopathology and bioaccumulation in common carp ( cyprinus carpio ) of two rivers and a lake in japan : potential for endocrine disruption .. to investigate endocrine disruption and chemical contaminant levels in the aquatic environment , serum vitellogenin ( vtg ) induction , steroid hormone synthesis , gonad histopathology and nonylphenol ( np ) bioaccumulation were measured in common carp ( cyprinus carpio ) in three sites ( two rivers and one lake , in which high , medium , and low np concentrations were detected in a previous study ) in japan from november 2001 to february 2002 . the average gonadosomatic indexes ( gsis ) for males were 3 . 9 % in the ishizu river , 5 . 6 % in the imba discharge channel , and 4 . 2 % in teganuma . no testis - ova in the gonads were found in any of the captured carp in this study . abnormalities in testis were observed in individuals ( n = 2 / 15 ) captured in the imba discharge channel , and retraction and unusual cell proliferation were observed in the testis of the same fish . serum vtg was detected in 40 % of the male samples captured in the ishizu river and in 53 % of the male samples captured in the imba discharge channel . the levels of alkylphenols and bisphenol a , as well as estrogenic activity , were determined in the aquatic environment . in additional caging experiments in the nikko river ( medium np concentration ), male carp showed np bioconcentration after the exposure to the river water .	0
environmental endocrine disruptors promote invasion and metastasis of sk - n - sh human neuroblastoma cells .. neuroblastoma ( nb ) is the most common pediatric extracranial cancer . metastasis is the main cause of mortality in nb patients . currently , little is known about the risk factors and their mechanisms that cause metastasis . environmental endocrine disruptors ( eed ) are recently identified risk factors associated with various human diseases including malignant tumors . our previous studies have implicated the role of di ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) and bisphenol a ( bpa ), two of the most common eed , in neuroblastoma cell proliferation . here , we further investigated the effects of dehp , bpa as well as 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) on the invasion and metastasis of human neuroblastoma sk - n - sh cells in vitro . sk - n - sh cells expressed estrogen receptor ( er )- beta , matrix metalloproteinases - 2 ( mmp - 2 ), mmp - 9 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase - 2 ( timp - 2 ) at readily detectable levels . 50 microm dehp , 0 . 1 microm bpa and 10 microm e2 exposure all resulted in enhanced motility and invasiveness of sk - n - sh cells ( p < 0 . 001 ), elevated expression of mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 , and decreased expression of timp - 2 ( p < 0 . 01 ). furthermore , phosphorylation of akt ( ser473 ) was also induced following the exposure ( p < 0 . 01 ). importantly , both er antagonist ici182 , 780 and phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) specific inhibitor ly294002 significantly inhibited the dehp , bpa , or e2 - induced cell migration and invasion , as well as the disregulation of mmp - 2 , mmp - 9 and timp - 2 expression . ici182 , 780 may have worked through abolishing akt ( ser473 ) phosphorylation . in conclusion , dehp , bpa , and e2 potently promote invasion and metastasis of neuroblastoma cells through overexpression of mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 as well as downregulation of timp - 2 . er - dependent pathway and pi3k / akt pathway are involved , which may become potential therapeutic targets for neuroblastoma treatment .	0

in vitro effects of bisphenol a on developing hypothalamic neurons .. estradiol plays an essential role in sexual differentiation of the rodent hypothalamus . endocrine disruptors with estrogenic activity such as bisphenol a ( bpa ) are reported to disturb sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus . the purpose of the present study was to examine in vitro effects of bpa on developing hypothalamic neurons by focusing on a presynaptic protein synapsin i and microtubule - associated protein 2 ( map2 ). in cultured hypothalamic cells from fetal rats , treatment with bpa enhanced both dendritic and synaptic development , as evidenced by increases in the area of dot - like staining of synapsin i and map2 - positive area . an estrogen receptor ( er ) antagonist , ici 182 , 780 , only partially blocked bpa - induced increase in the synapsin i - area , while it suppressed the map2 - area increased by bpa . a specific erk inhibitor , u0126 , reduced the synapsin i - area without affecting the map2 - area . bpa significantly decreased protein levels of synapsin i phosphorylated at ser - 9 and ser - 603 . these findings indicate that bpa - inducing effects on dendritic and synaptic development are mediated by different molecular pathways .	0
high - throughput screening of selectivity of melt polymerization catalysts using fluorescence spectroscopy and two - wavelength fluorescence imaging .. a new general approach for rapid assessment of polymerization catalysts is introduced . native fluorescence emission of solid polymers is measured directly in combinatorial 96 - microreactor arrays and polymers produced in a laboratory - scale validation reactor . fluorescence features collected with a ccd - based spectrofluorometer are correlated with chemical properties of interest such as polymer molecular weight , amount of branching , and catalyst selectivity . the approach is illustrated by screening of selectivity of melt polymerization catalysts used in synthesis of an aromatic bisphenol a polycarbonate . selectivity of catalysts correlated with the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 400 and 500 nm at 340 - nm excitation . the relative standard deviation ( rsd ) in spectroscopic serial measurements was 1 - 12 . 5 %. this spread included instrument variability (< or = 1 % rsd ) and sample inhomogeneity . parallel quantitative screening of catalyst selectivity in combinatorial 96 - microreactor arrays was performed as a two - wavelength ratiometric fluorescence imaging through 400 - and 500 - nm interference filters and showed a good correlation ( r2 = 0 . 994 ) with serial screening . our approach is an attractive alternative to traditional separation - based techniques if speed and nondestructive nature of analysis are critical and when the high cross - linking or solvent resistance of polymers complicates traditional analysis .	0
bisphenol a : developmental toxicity from early prenatal exposure .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) exposure has been documented in pregnant women , but consequences for development are not yet widely studied in human populations . this review presents research on the consequences for offspring of bpa exposure during pregnancy . extensive work in laboratory rodents has evaluated survival and growth of the conceptus , interference with embryonic programs of development , morphological sex differentiation , sex differentiation of the brain and behavior , immune responsiveness , and mechanism of action . sensitive measures include rar , aryl hydrocarbon receptor , and hox a10 gene expression , anogenital distance , sex differentiation of affective and exploratory behavior , and immune hyperresponsiveness . many bpa effects are reported at low doses ( 10 - 50 µg / kg d range ) by the oral route of administration . at high doses (> 500 , 000 µg / kg d ) fetal viability is compromised . much of the work has centered around the implications of the estrogenic actions of this agent . some work related to thyroid mechanism of action has also been explored . bpa research has actively integrated current knowledge of developmental biology , concepts of endocrine disruption , and toxicological research to provide a basis for human health risk assessment .	0
neonatal xenoestrogen exposure alters growth hormone - dependent liver proteins and genes in adult female rats .. the hypothalamic - growth hormone ( gh )- liver axis represents a new concept in endocrine regulation of drug toxicity . preponderant sex differences are found in liver gene expression , mostly dependent on the sexually dimorphic pattern of gh secretion which is set during the neonatal period by gonadal steroids . we tested if gh - dependent sexually dimorphic liver enzymes and proteins was perturbed by neonatal bisphenol a ( bpa ) treatment in female rats . female rats were sc injected with bpa ( 50 or 500 μg / 50 μl ) or castor oil vehicle from postnatal day 1 to 10 . at five months serum prolactin , pituitary gh , and serum and liver insulin growth factor - i ( igf - i ) were measured by ria . major urinary proteins ( mups ) were determined by electrophoresis . liver cyp2c11 , cyp2c12 , adh1 , hnf6 , and prlr mrna levels were determined by real time pcr . pituitary gh content and liver igf - i concentration were increased by neonatal bpa treatment , indicating partial masculinization of the gh axis in treated females . gh - dependent female predominant liver enzyme genes ( cyp2c12 and adh1 ) and a transcription factor ( hnf6 ) were downregulated or defeminized , while there were no changes in a male predominant gene ( cyp2c11 ) or protein ( mup ). our findings indicate that perinatal exposure to bpa may compromise the sexually dimorphic capacity of the liver to metabolize drugs and steroids .	0
effect of neonatal treatment of rats with potent or weak ( environmental ) oestrogens , or with a gnrh antagonist , on leydig cell development and function through puberty into adulthood .. this study addressed whether reduced sertoli cell number or manipulation of the neonatal hormone environment has an influence on final leydig cell number per testis in the rat , by applying neonatal treatments known to affect these parameters , namely administration of a gnrh antagonist ( gnrha ) or diethylstilboestrol ( des , in doses of 10 , 1 or 0 . 1 microg per injection ). the effect of treatment with either of two ' environmental oestrogens ', bisphenol - a ( bis - a ) or octylphenol ( op ), was also evaluated . leydig ( 3beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase immunopositive ) cell development and function ( plasma testosterone levels ) were studied through puberty into adulthood . treatment with gnrha impaired testis growth , leydig cell ( nuclear ) volume per testis and testosterone levels during puberty , when compared with controls , but final leydig cell volume / number in adulthood was comparable with controls . as adult testis weight was reduced by 45 % in gnrha - treated rats , the percentage leydig cell volume per testis was approximately double ( p < 0 . 01 ) that in controls , and also at day 35 . testosterone levels in adulthood in gnrha - treated rats were lower ( p < 0 . 01 ) than in controls but were within the lower end of the normal range . treatment with des caused largely dose - dependent suppression of testis growth , leydig cell ( nuclear ) volume per testis and testosterone levels up to day 35 . although by adulthood , leydig cell volume / number per testis was comparable with controls in des - treated rats , testosterone levels remained grossly subnormal . neonatal treatment with either bis - a or op had little consistent effect on any of the parameters studied except that both treatments significantly elevated testosterone levels on day 18 , as did treatment with des - 0 . 1 microg . the present findings are interpreted in the context of what is known about the hormonal regulation of leydig cell development . these lead to the conclusion that final leydig cell number per testis is not determined by the number of sertoli cells per testis and appears not to be influenced in any major way by gonadotrophins , androgens or oestrogens in the first 2 weeks of postnatal life . this implies that adult leydig cell number may be determined prior to birth .	0
effect of laboratory procedures and thermocycling on the shear bond strength of resin - metal bonding systems .. statement of problem : during fabrication or repair of removable partial dentures , resin - to - metal or resin - to - denture tooth bonds may be stressed by laboratory procedures . purpose : the purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of steam cleaning , boiling , ultrasonic cleaning ( laboratory procedures ), and thermocycling on shear bond strength of resin bonds to metal and denture teeth . material and methods : resin - metal bonding systems and their specific veneer resins ( rocatec , sinfony ; rocatec , visio - gem , hlc - bond , zeta lc and ducera experimental veneer resin ) were tested on a co - cr alloy ( wirobond c ). the veneer resins were bonded to resin denture teeth . the experimental groups ( n = 7 ) were subjected to the following conditions : 24 - hour storage of the specimens in air ( group i , control group ), storage in air and treated with simulated laboratory procedures ( 2 minutes steam cleaning , 15 minutes ultrasonic cleaning at room temperature , 1 hour boiling in water , group ii ), storage in air with thermocycling ( 5000 cycles , 5 degrees to 55 degrees c , group iii ), storage in air with laboratory procedures followed by thermocycling ( group iv ), and storage in air with thermocycling followed by laboratory procedures ( group v ). shear strength tests ( mpa ) were performed with a universal testing machine until fracture . after shear bond testing , the failure mode of the resin - metal and resin - denture tooth bonds was assessed . statistical analysis of the results was carried out with one - way analysis of variance and bonferroni - dunn ' s multiple comparisons post hoc analysis for test groups ( alpha = 0 . 05 ). results : except for ducera / denture tooth specimens ( groups iii to v : 8 . 7 +/- 3 . 4 - 9 . 1 +/- 1 . 7 ; 10 . 8 +/- 1 . 9 mpa control group ), the wirobond c and denture tooth specimens ( groups iii , iv and v : 1 . 4 +/- 0 . 9 - 11 . 9 +/- 2 . 3 mpa ), showed significantly lower shear bond strengths than the corresponding control groups ( 7 . 5 +/- 2 . 9 - 21 . 0 +/- 3 . 4 mpa , p <. 05 ). the shear bond strengths of group ii of sinfony / wirobond c ( 11 . 6 +/- 3 . 3 mpa , p <. 0001 ), visio - gem / wirobond c ( 7 . 4 +/- 1 . 9 mpa , p < 0 . 0001 ), ducera / wirobond c ( 11 . 8 +/- 2 . 9 mpa , p <. 0001 ) and of zeta / denture tooth ( 3 . 9 +/- 1 . 6 mpa , p =. 0005 ) were significantly decreased by steam , boiling , and ultrasonic procedures compared with the corresponding control groups ( 21 . 0 +/- 3 . 4 mpa ; 14 . 7 +/- 4 . 0 mpa ; 19 . 1 +/- 2 . 3 mpa ; 7 . 5 +/- 2 . 9 mpa , respectively ). no significant differences were noted among groups iii , iv , and v . co - cr specimens subjected to the rocatec system and bonded with sinfony and hlc bond / zeta specimens showed cohesive failure . adhesive failure was observed for the experimental veneer resin on the co - cr specimens and for all veneer resins on the denture teeth . conclusion : simulation of laboratory procedures and thermocycling caused a significant drop in shear bond strength of metal - resin and denture tooth - resin bonds for most of the tested veneer resins . thermocycling before shear testing had the same effect on veneer resin bond strength as the simulated laboratory procedures .	0
cytotoxicity of dentine - bonding agents on human pulp cells in vitro .. aim : to investigate the cytotoxicity of five different dentine - bonding agents on human pulp cells in vitro . methodology : set specimens from clearfil se bond ( cb ), heliobond ( hb ), prime & bond nt ( pb ), single bond ( sb ), and syntac single component ( sc ) were eluted with culture medium for 2 and 5 days . cytotoxicity was judged using tetrazolium bromide reduction assay on human primary pulp cells . results : elutes from five dentine - bonding agents were cytotoxic to primary human pulp cells ( p < 0 . 05 ). cb was the least toxic sealer amongst the chemicals tested . the cytotoxic response decreased in an order of sb > pb > sc > hb > cb . conclusions : the influence of the cytotoxicity depended on the materials tested . dentine - bonding agents have significant potential for pulpal toxicity .	0
urinary , circulating , and tissue biomonitoring studies indicate widespread exposure to bisphenol a .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is one of the highest - volume chemicals produced worldwide , and human exposure to bpa is thought to be ubiquitous . thus , there are concerns that the amount of bpa to which humans are exposed may cause adverse health effects . we examined many possibilities for why biomonitoring and toxicokinetic studies could come to seemingly conflicting conclusions . more than 80 published human biomonitoring studies that measured bpa concentrations in human tissues , urine , blood , and other fluids , along with two toxicokinetic studies of human bpa metabolism were examined . unconjugated bpa was routinely detected in blood ( in the nanograms per milliliter range ), and conjugated bpa was routinely detected in the vast majority of urine samples ( also in the nanograms per milliliter range ). in stark contrast , toxicokinetic studies proposed that humans are not internally exposed to bpa . available data from biomonitoring studies clearly indicate that the general population is exposed to bpa and is at risk from internal exposure to unconjugated bpa . the two toxicokinetic studies that suggested human bpa exposure is negligible have significant deficiencies , are directly contradicted by hypothesis - driven studies , and are therefore not reliable for risk assessment purposes .	0
[ effects of endocrine disruptors on preimplantation embryo development ].. endocrine disruptors such as dioxins and bisphenol a ( bpa ) were detected in the human follicular fluids indicating that the reproductive organs have been exposed to these substances . to study possible effects of these chemicals on the germ cells and early embryos , we employed mouse preimplantation embryo development models . dioxin ( tcdd ) and bpa both have positive and negative effects on embryo development in mice . the developmental rates were significantly decreased by exposure to concentrations of tcdd between 1 and 5 pm as compared with the control group . on the other hand , stimulatory effects of bpa were observed in the blastocyst formation rate at concentrations of 1 nm and 3 nm . the present study demonstrated that low concentration of both tcdd and bpa , not dose dependent manner , exert stimulatory or inhibitory effects on preimplantation embryo development . these alterations in low doses may be mediated by ahr or er alpha and er beta , present in mouse preimplantation embryos .	0
determination of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol a and its derivatives in canned foods .. migration of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol a ( dgeba ) to food from can enamels and can pull - top seals is reported . derivatives of dgeba are also determined in some foods . levels of dgeba in the foods surveyed in this study range from nondetected (< 0 . 3 ppb ) to 50 mg / kg as determined by liquid - liquid extraction or solid - phase extraction coupled with high - pressure liquid chromatography using fluorescence detection . confirmation of the analytes is by gas and / or liquid chromatography with mass spectral analysis . fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with 30 degrees specular reflectance / transmittance is used to characterize the coated food contact surfaces . stability studies with dgeba in water , acid , and saline solutions show conversion to the hydrolysis products and chloro adducts occurs readily . the presence of dgeba derivatives in food demonstrates that analysis for dgeba migration alone is not a good indicator of total migration from can coatings to foods .	0
male reproductive organs are at risk from environmental hazards .. male reproductive disorders that are of interest from an environmental point of view include sexual dysfunction , infertility , cryptorchidism , hypospadias and testicular cancer . several reports suggest declining sperm counts and increase of these reproductive disorders in some areas during some time periods past 50 years . except for testicular cancer this evidence is circumstantial and needs cautious interpretation . however , the male germ line is one of the most sensitive tissues to the damaging effects of ionizing radiation , radiant heat and a number of known toxicants . so far occupational hazards are the best documented risk factors for impaired male reproductive function and include physical exposures ( radiant heat , ionizing radiation , high frequency electromagnetic radiation ), chemical exposures ( some solvents as carbon disulfide and ethylene glycol ethers , some pesticides as dibromochloropropane , ethylendibromide and ddt / dde , some heavy metals as inorganic lead and mercury ) and work processes such as metal welding . improved working conditions in affluent countries have dramatically decreased known hazardous workplace exposures , but millions of workers in less affluent countries are at risk from reproductive toxicants . new data show that environmental low - level exposure to biopersistent pollutants in the diet may pose a risk to people in all parts of the world . for other toxicants the evidence is only suggestive and further evaluation is needed before conclusions can be drawn . whether compounds as phthalates , bisphenol a and boron that are present in a large number of industrial and consumer products entails a risk remains to be established . the same applies to psychosocial stressors and use of mobile phones . finally , there are data indicating a particular vulnerability of the fetal testis to toxicants - for instance maternal tobacco smoking . time has come where male reproductive toxicity should be addressed form entirely new angles including exposures very early in life .	0
xenoestrogens modulate vascular endothelial growth factor secretion in breast cancer cells through an estrogen receptor - dependent mechanism .. environmental chemicals may affect human health by disrupting endocrine function . their possible role in the mammary gland and breast tumors is still unknown . previous studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ), a key factor in angiogenesis and tumor progression , is an estrogen - regulated gene . we analyzed whether vegf expression is regulated by different xenoestrogens in several breast cancer cells , meln ( derived from mcf - 7 ) and melp ( derived from mda - mb - 231 ) and stably expressing estrogen receptor alpha ( eralpha ); these cell lines stably express estrogen response element ( beta - globin )- luciferase . genistein , bisphenol a ( bpa ), 4 -( tert - octyl ) phenol ( op ), dieldrin , and several phthalates , including benzyl butyl phthalate ( bbp ) and di - ethyl - 2 - hexyle phthalate ( dehp ), were first shown to be estrogenic . these compounds induced a dose - dependent increase of vegf secretion in meln and mcf - 7 cells ; maximal effect was observed at 1 - 10 microm non - cytotoxic concentrations and was inhibited by the antiestrogen ici 182 780 . vegf increase was not observed in eralpha - negative mda - mb - 231 cells . most substances increased vegf transcript levels in meln cells . in contrast , gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane , vinclozolin , and the phthalates ( mono - n - butyl ester phthalic acid , di - isononyle phthalate , and di - isodecyle phthalate ) were ineffective on both vegf secretion and estrogenic luciferase induction in these cell lines . specific kinase inhibitors pd98059 , sb203580 , or ly294002 suppressed the xenoestrogen - induced vegf response , suggesting activation of mek , p38 kinase , and phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase pathways . our in vitro results show for the first time that genistein and xenoestrogens ( bpa , op , dieldrin , bbp , and dehp at high concentrations ) up - regulate vegf expression in meln cells by an er - dependent mechanism . since vegf increases capillary permeability and breast tumor angiogenesis in vivo , the physiological relevance of these findings is discussed .	0
quantification of bisphenol a , 353 - nonylphenol and their chlorinated derivatives in drinking water treatment plants .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) and nonylphenols ( np ) are of major concern to public health due to their high potential for human exposure and to their demonstrated toxicity ( endocrine disruptor effect ). a limited number of studies have shown that bpa and np are present in drinking water . the chlorinated derivatives that may be formed during the chlorination step in drinking water treatment plants ( dwtp ) exhibit a higher level of estrogenic activity than their parent compounds . the aim of this study was to investigate bpa , 353np , and their chlorinated derivative concentrations using an accurate and reproducible method of quantification . this method was applied to both surface and treated water samples from eight french dwtps producing from surface water . solid - phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry was developed in order to quantify target compounds from water samples . the limits of detection ranged from 0 . 3 to 2 . 3 ng / l for bpa and chlorinated bpa and from 1 . 4 to 63 . 0 ng / l for 353np and chlorinated 353np . bpa and 353np were found in most analyzed water samples , at a level ranging from 2 . 0 to 29 . 7 ng / l and from 0 to 124 . 9 ng / l , respectively . in most of dwtps a decrease of bpa and 353np was observed between surface water and treated water ( 36 . 6 to 78 . 9 % and 2 . 2 to 100 . 0 % for bpa and 353np , respectively ). neither chlorinated bpa nor chlorinated 353np was detected . even though bpa and 353np have been largely removed in the dwtps studied , they have not been completely eliminated , and drinking water may consequently remain a source of human exposure .	0
micro - shear bond strength of adhesive systems to cementum .. purpose : to investigate the micro - shear bond strength of current adhesive systems to human cementum and compare the results with those to dentin . methods : two commercially available two - step adhesive systems were investigated ; a self - etching primer system ( clearfil se bond ) and a total - etch wet bonding adhesive system ( single bond ). the cementum and dentin surfaces were chosen from the mesial surfaces of extracted human molars and then bonded with each adhesive system . a micro - shear bond test was employed to evaluate the bond strength in this study . in addition , the etched cementum or dentin surfaces without any adhesive and the bonded interfaces between the adhesive and the cementum or the dentin were studied morphologically using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ). results : no significant differences were found between the adhesive systems used ( p > 0 . 05 ). however , both adhesive systems showed significantly lower bonding to cementum than to dentin ( p < 0 . 05 ). the relatively lower bond strengths to cementum probably resulted from the existence of coarse collagen fibers , which may cause less or inhomogeneous penetration of resin monomers into the etched zone .	0
normal reproductive organ development in wistar rats exposed to bisphenol a in the drinking water .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a chemical used primarily as a monomer in the manufacture of numerous chemical products , such as epoxy resins and polycarbonate . the objective of this study was to evaluate potential effects of bpa on sexual development of male rats and was designed to clarify low - dose observations reported as preliminary results by sharpe et al . ( 1996 ). the protocol for the present study followed the same treatment schedule as reported by sharpe et al . ( 1995 , 1996 ), but included more treatment groups , a greater number of animals per group , and a more comprehensive number of reproductive endpoints . groups of 28 female han - wistar albino rats were exposed to drinking water that contained 0 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 , 1 . 0 , or 10 ppm bpa or 0 . 1 ppm diethylstilbestrol ( des ), 7 days per week , for a total of 10 weeks . treatment of the females began at 10 weeks of age and continued throughout a 2 - week premating period , 2 weeks of mating ( to untreated males ), 21 - 22 days of gestation , and 22 days of lactation . offspring weanling males were given untreated drinking water and maintained until 90 days of age when evaluations were made of various reproductive organs . consistent with sharpe et al . ( 1996 ) the female offspring were not evaluated . no treatment - related effects on growth or reproductive endpoints were observed in adult females exposed to any concentration of bpa . similarly , no treatment - related effects were observed on the growth , survival , or reproductive parameters ( including testes , prostate and preputial gland weights , sperm count , daily sperm production , or testes histopathology ) of male offspring from dams exposed to bpa during gestation and lactation . des administered in the drinking water at 0 . 1 ppm resulted in decreased body weight , body weight change , and food consumption in adult females . in addition , an increase in the duration of gestation and a decrease in the number of pups delivered and number of live pups were also observed in animals exposed to des . in conclusion , these results do not confirm the previous findings of sharpe et al . ( 1996 ) and show that low doses of bpa had no effects on male sexual development in the rat .	0

lack of effects for low dose levels of bisphenol a and diethylstilbestrol on the prostate gland of cf1 mice exposed in utero .. vom saal et al . ( proc . natl . acad . sci . 94 , 2056 - 2061 , 1997 ) have reported that low dose exposure ( 0 . 02 - 2 microg / kg / day ) of cf1 mice to diethylstilbestrol ( des ) in utero led to increases in the prostate gland weight when the pups reached 8 months of age . nagel et al . ( environ . health perspect . 105 , 70 - 76 , 1997 ) reported similar effects in cf1 mice at 6 months of age after exposure in utero to low dose levels ( 2 and 20 microg / kg / day ) of bisphenol a ( bpa ). vom saal et al . ( toxicol . indust . health 14 ( 1 / 2 ) 239 - 260 , 1998 ) subsequently reported reduced sperm efficiency ( daily sperm production per gram testes ) in a subset of the bpa animals for which enlarged prostates had been observed . these three experiments have been repeated in a single experiment that was terminated when the offspring reached 6 months of age . no statistically significant effects on prostate weight or sperm efficiency were recorded for offspring of animals exposed to either des ( 0 . 2 microg / kg / day ) or bpa ( 2 and 20 microg / kg / day ) in utero . significant dam effects were seen for several of the assay parameters indicating that the litter , as opposed to the individual , should be considered as the statistical unit in such experiments . a statistically significant increase in body weight was recorded for the low dose bpa male offspring . females from the study underwent normal sexual maturation and showed no significant differences in reproductive tissue weights at termination and the mean day of vaginal opening . the possible reasons for this failure to confirm the earlier reported effects for des and bpa at these low doses are discussed .	0
fish test for endocrine - disruption and estimation of water quality of japanese rivers .. the lc50 values ( 72 h ) of 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ), p - nonylphenol ( np ) and bis - phenol - a ( bpa ) to adult male and female medaka were 3 . 5 and 3 . 5 , 0 . 85 and 0 . 87 , and 6 . 8 and 8 . 3 mg l (- 1 ), respectively ; the lc50 values to embryos were 0 . 46 , 0 . 13 and 5 . 1 mg l (- 1 ), respectively . the ic50 values for inhibition to egg hatching were 0 . 47 , 0 . 85 and 9 . 0 mg l (- 1 ), respectively . these values were much higher than concentrations detected in river water in japan and the chemicals were considered to have no lethal effect on the fish in an aquatic environment . mature male medaka was continuously exposed to 0 . 005 , 0 . 05 or 1 . 0 microg l (- 1 ) of e2 , or to 0 . 1 , 10 or 100 microg l (- 1 ) of np or bpa . female specific proteins ( fsp ) were induced in the blood of male medaka that were exposed for 5 weeks to e2 higher than 0 . 005 microg l (- 1 ), np higher than 0 . 1 microg l (- 1 ), or bpa higher than 10 microg l (- 1 ). based on these fsp inducible concentrations and reported concentrations of e2 , np and bpa in japanese river water , some river water contaminated by e2 or np could be estimated as the fsp inducible in male medaka .	0
[ determination of bisphenol a in foods using gc / ms ].. an analytical method using gc / ms was developed for bisphenol a ( bpa ) in foods and bpa was determined in canned foods and fresh foods such as vegetables , fruit and meat . bpa was extracted with acetone from the samples and the extract was concentrated at under 40 degrees c in vacuo to afford an aqueous solution , which was washed with hexane after alkalization and extracted with 50 % diethyl ether - hexane after acidification . extracts were cleaned up on a psa and / or a c18 cartridge column , and bpa was derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride and determined by gc / ms ( sim ). this method was applicable to the detection and determination of bpa residues in food samples at the level of 1 ng / g . among canned foods , bpa was found in 6 corned beef , 1 chicken , 9 sweet corn and 3 bean samples at the levels of 17 - 602 ng / g , 212 ng / g , 2 . 3 - 75 ng / g and 3 . 5 - 26 ng / g , respectively . bpa was also detected in 1 retort soup and 1 retort pack product at the levels of 11 ng / g and 86 ng / g , respectively . as for dairy products , bpa was not detected in butter and milk . among fresh foods , bpa was detected in 2 fish and 3 liver samples at the levels of trace ( tr )- 6 . 2 ng / g and tr - 2 . 2 ng / g , respectively . in vegetables , fruits and chocolates , a trace level of bpa was detected in only 1 chocolate . traces of bpa were also detected in 3 samples of 6 boxed lunches .	0
distribution of 14c - bisphenol a in pregnant and newborn mice .. objectives : the purpose of the present investigation was to trace the fate of bisphenol a injected into pregnant mice , focusing on its potential accumulation in the fetus and the brain , critical targets of hormonal chemicals , using whole - body autoradiography . methods : pregnant mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0 . 46mbq of ( 14 ) c - bpa and then killed at 1h or 1 , 3 , or 5 days after injection . sections for autoradiography were prepared in a cryomicrotome and the exposed imaging plate was processed using a fluorescent / radioisotope image analyzer . results : intraperitoneally injected ( 14 ) c - bpa was distributed throughout the body , including the fetus and the brain , within 1h . radioactivity faded gradually from the whole body by the fifth day , and no accumulation in any specific organ was found . however , although ( 14 ) c was detected in the fetuses immediately after injection , the transfer of bpa from mother to newborn was not observed . significance : the routes of rapid bpa discharge were confirmed , and bpa neither accumulated in the body nor was it transferred to newborn mice . no evidence was observed to suggest the existence of a blood - placenta or blood - brain barrier for bpa . this information should be taken into consideration when assessing the risks of using dental materials that contain bpa .	0
isolation and characterization of novel bisphenol - a -- degrading bacteria from soils .. one hundred and seven soil samples were collected from various places in japan , and their bisphenol - a ( bpa , 2 , 2 - bis ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) propane ) degradative capacities were evaluated . eighty - five soil samples possessed bpa degradative capacities , and 26 bacterial strains could be isolated as bpa - degrading bacterium . sequence analysis of their 16s rrna genes indicated that 22 isolates belonged to proteobacteria groups , and three of four gram - positive bacterial strains , ya27 , no13 , and no15 , were classified as bacilli . all isolates except strain ya27 completely degraded 115 microg / ml bpa in l medium but strain ya27 degraded only 50 microg / ml bpa . strain ya27 and three sphingomonas sp . strains could also grow in basal salt media containing bpa as a sole carbon source ( bsmb medium ). in hplc analyses , some isolates , including the three sphingomonas strains , produced some bpa metabolites in their cultures although the others , including strain ya27 , produced no detectable metabolite . furthermore , the pseudomonas strains su1 and su4 produced some bpa metabolites that were different from the metabolites detected in the degradation of bpa by the s . bisphenolicum strain ao1 . these results suggested that all isolates could be applicable to the bioremediation of bpa - polluted soil and water . furthermore , we suggest that bacillus sp . ya27 and pseudomonas su1 and su4 may exhibit novel bpa metabolism pathways that are distinct from that of s . bisphenolicum ao1 .	0

fracture strength of endodontically treated teeth restored with different strategies after mechanical cycling .. the aim of this study was to analyze the fracture strength of endodontically treated teeth with different coronal restoration strategies after mechanical cycling . thirty bovine teeth were randomly allocated into three groups ( n = 10 ): group 1 , cast metal post and core ; group 2 , glass fiber post with a composite resin core ; group 3 , glass fiber post with a glass prefabricated core . for post cementation , an etch and rinse multistep adhesive system and resin cement were used . the specimens were submitted to mechanical cycling ( 106 cycles , 90 n , 4 hz , 37 ± 1 degree c ) and immediately loaded in a universal testing machine . the statistical analysis ( one - way anova ) did not indicate a significant difference among the tested groups ( group 1 = 593 . 9 ± 128 . 7 n ; group 2 = 554 . 4 ± 213 . 3 n ; group 3 = 427 ± 104 . 8 n ; p = 0 . 06 ). with regard to fracture patterns , all group 1 specimens demonstrated catastrophic failures , while the specimens in groups 2 and 3 demonstrated core or core / post failure . despite the similar fracture strength observed in the tested groups , teeth restored with composite resin or glass prefabricated cores demonstrated favorable failure patterns compared to the cast metal post and core group . this study demonstrates that a glass prefabricated core can be an acceptable alternative for the reconstruction of endodontically treated teeth .	0
a direct capillary liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection method for determination of phenols in water samples .. a fast and direct method based on the use of capillary liquid chromatography ( lc ) with electrochemical ( ec ) detection has been described for phenols pollutants in water samples . concretely , phenol , o - cresol , 2 - chlorophenol and bisphenol a have been selected as target analytes . the combination of capillary lc with ec detection avoided the necessity of preconcentration steps typically used in environmental analysis . the sample injected volume was 2μl . the achieved detection limits were between 1 and 2μg / l and the linear dynamic range was up to 50μg / l for all studied phenols . the precision and uncertainty were satisfactory . the analysis time per sample was 10min . the proposed procedure has been proved useful for treated waters .	0
oral exposure to low - dose bisphenol a aggravates testosterone - induced benign hyperplasia prostate in rats .. the declining level of androgen during aging , associated with an inclining level of estrogen , has been hypothesized to be important in the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ). within physiologic range , increasing estrogen levels can stimulate prostate to develop and permanently increase prostate size . as an estrogenic endocrine disruptor , bisphenol a ( bpa ) might be stimulatory to prostate development . we further hypothesized that low dose bpa could induce hyperplasia prostate to proliferate and aggravate the symptom of bph in male sd rats . bph was induced by testosterone and then treated with bpa ( 10 , 30 , or 90 μg / kg , i . g ., daily ), 17β - estradiol ( e ( 2 ); 50 . 0 μg / kg , s . c ., daily ), or vehicle for 4 weeks . we found that weight and volume in rats treated with low dose bpa ( 10 μg / kg ) was higher than that of model control , and bpa significantly increased the relative weight of prostate ( p < 0 . 01 ). for prostate lobes , bpa 10 μg / kg / day significantly increased relative weight of ventral prostate ( vp ), weight and relative weight of dorsolateral prostate ( dlp ) ( p < 0 . 05 ). and histopathology results showed that height of epithelial cell ( hec ) of vp and dlp in bpa group were significantly higher than that of model control ( p < 0 . 01 ). bpa could also decrease testosterone level and increase prostate - specific antigen level . e ( 2 ) treatment also showed an obvious effect on relative weight of vp and dlp , hec , and hormone levels . we concluded that environment exposure to low dose of bpa may induce prostate to proliferate and aggravate testosterone - induced benign hyperplasia prostate in rats .	0

structural optimization and biological evaluation of substituted bisphenol a derivatives as beta - amyloid peptide aggregation inhibitors .. the aggregation of abeta is a crucial step in the etiology of alzheimer ' s disease . our previous work showed that abeta undergoes alpha - helix / beta - sheet intermediate structures during the conformational transition , and an abeta aggregation inhibitor ( 1 ) was discovered by targeting the intermediates . here , structure optimization toward compound 1 was performed and 34 novel derivatives were designed and synthesized . nine compounds showed more effective inhibitory activity than the hit compound 1 in tht fluorescence assay . among them , compound 43 demonstrated more excellent inhibitory potency , which not only can suppress the aggregation of abeta but also can dissolve the preformed fibrils as shown by cd spectroscopy , picup and afm assays . cellular assay indicated that 43 has no toxicity to neuronal cells , moreover , can effectively inhibit abeta ( 1 - 42 )- induced neutrotoxicity and increase the cell viability . together , on the basis of these positive results , these novel chemical structures may provide a promising potential for therapeutic applications in ad and other types of neurodegenerative disorders .	0
double - blind randomized clinical trial of posterior composite restorations with or without bevel : 6 - month follow - up .. aim : this double - blind randomized clinical trial compared the performance of posterior composite restorations with and without bevel . methods and materials : thirteen volunteers requiring at least two posterior class ii restorations were selected . twenty - nine cavity preparations were performed , comprising 14 without bevel ( butt joint ) and 15 with marginal beveling . all cavities were restored with a simplified adhesive system ( adper single bond , 3m espe , st . paul , minnesota , usa ) and composite resin ( filtek p60 , 3m espe , st . paul , minnesota , usa ). a halogen light - curing unit ( xl 3000 , 3m espe , st . paul , minnesota , usa ) was used throughout the study . restorations were polished immediately . analysis was carried out at baseline and after six months by a calibrated evaluator ( kappa ), according to fdi criteria . results : the results were statistically analyzed by kruskal - wallis and mann - whitney tests ( p < 0 . 05 ). beveled and nonbeveled restorations performed similarly after six months in relation to fractures and retention , marginal adaptation , postoperative hypersensitivity , recurrence of caries , surface luster , and anatomic form . however , for surface and marginal staining , beveled restorations showed significantly better performance than butt joint restorations ( p < 0 . 05 ). conclusion : restorations performed were acceptable after six months , but beveled restorations showed less marginal staining than nonbeveled restorations . clinical significance : bevel used in posterior composite restorations decreased the surface and marginal staining , in six - month evaluations .	0
chemical monitoring and occurrence of alkylphenols , alkylphenol ethoxylates , alcohol ethoxylates , phthalates and benzothiazoles in sewage treatment plants and receiving waters along the ter river basin ( catalonia , n . e . spain ).. this study presents a quantitative estimation of the analysis and fate of several emerging pollutants , some of them endocrine - disrupting compounds , in surface water samples collected at several locations along the ter river and two of its tributaries . influent and effluent waters and particulate matter from five sewage treatment plants ( stp ) that discharge into these rivers were also studied . the target compounds analyzed were : nonylphenol ethoxylates ( npeo ), nonylphenol ( np ), octylphenol ( op ), bisphenol a ( bpa ), phthalates , alcohol ethoxylates ( aeo ) and benzothiazoles . chemical analysis by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry using an electrospray interface ( lc - esi - ms ) revealed the presence of low amounts ( between 0 . 06 and 17 . 5 microg l (- 1 )) of the target compounds npe ( 1 + 2 ) o and np , which were detected in 100 % and 84 % of the samples respectively . maximum concentrations occurred in the stps associated with the municipalities of vic and girona . from the fate and behavior data obtained for the various compounds analyzed in the stp influent and effluent , we can conclude that the stps are effective at removing large amounts ( more than 70 %) of the compounds studied from the water .	0
interaction of bisphenol a with bovine hemoglobin using spectroscopic and molecular modeling methods .. the interaction of bisphenol a with bovine hemoglobin ( bhb ) under physiological conditions was investigated by using fluorescence , ultraviolet - visible ( uv - vis ) absorption , circular dichroism ( cd ), and molecular modeling . the experimental results showed that bpa can bind with bhb to form a complex . the binding constant ka and the number of binding sites n were calculated to be 1 . 49 × 10 ( 5 ) l mol (- 1 ) and 1 , respectively . molecular modeling study revealed that bpa bound into bhb central cavity , and the binding mode of bpa - bhb complex could be hydrogen bonding . the uv - vis absorption and cd spectra indicated that the secondary structure of bhb was altered , which may affect physiological functions of hemoglobin . this work is helpful for clarifying the molecular toxic mechanism of bpa in vivo .	0
toxicokinetics of bisphenol a in female da / han rats after a single i . v . and oral administration .. bisphenol a [ bpa ; 2 , 2 - bis -( 4 - hydroxyphenyl )- propane ] is a monomer used in the manufacture of resins with a wide range of applications , e . g . plastic coatings in the food packaging industry . bpa has been shown to have a weak oestrogenic activity in vitro and in vivo . despite its low oestrogenic potency there is concern that , as a consequence of slow clearance , bpa might reach biologically significant levels in humans and animals exposed to environmental levels . to address this concern , we assessed the kinetic behaviour of bpa in female da / han rats . groups of female rats received 10 mg bpa / kg body weight intravenously or 10 or 100 mg bpa / kg body weight orally ( by gavage ). blood samples were collected at different time - points and plasma was prepared . free bpa in the samples was isolated by fluid - fluid extraction . bpa was measured by gc - ms which allowed the reliable determination of bpa concentrations as low as approximately 10 ng / ml plasma . immediately after i . v . administration , the bpa plasma concentration was in the range of about 15 microg / ml and decreased rapidly within the first hour ( to 700 ng / ml ). the levels declined further ( 100 ng / ml at 2 h ), and after 24 h the analytical detection limit was reached . bpa was detected in plasma as early as 10 min after gavage administration , indicating rapid initial uptake from the gastrointestinal tract . absorption of bpa was variable . in animals receiving 10 mg / kg , maximal plasma levels were reached after 1 . 5 h ( 31 ng / ml ) and 6 h ( 40 ng / ml ). in animals receiving 100 mg / kg , plasma levels reached maxima around 30 min ( 150 ng / ml ) and 3 h ( 134 ng / ml ) after administration . after 48 h bpa was at or below the detection limit in both dose groups . fluctuations in the bpa plasma concentrations over time point to the possibility of enterohepatic recirculation and protracted absorption from the gastrointestinal tract . using the area under the concentration - time curves ( aucs ), low bioavailabilities of 16 . 4 % and 5 . 6 % were calculated for the 10 and 100 mg / kg dose groups , respectively . the toxicokinetic properties of bpa in da / han rats are in agreement with the hypothesis of a rapid first - pass elimination by the liver and efficient metabolic clearance of low oral doses . only excessive doses may lead to bioaccumulation if detoxification pathways are saturated .	0

[ fetal exposure to endocrine disruptors ].. endocrine disruptors act to alter blood hormone levels or the subsequent action of hormones . disturbances of hormonal regulation during fetal or postnatal development in human may induce adverse effects , but these adverse effects of endocrine disruptors on humans are subtle . we investigated fetal exposure to endocrine disruptors in japan by analyzing umbilical cords or cord sera . many endocrine disruptors including dioxins , polychlorinated biphenyls , organochlorine pesticides , bisphenol a , nonylphenol and phytoestrogen were detected in umbilical cords and cord sera . here we summarize the present status of fetal exposure to endocrine disruptors in japan and other countries .	0
inhibition of staurosporine - induced neuronal cell death by bisphenol a and nonylphenol in primary cultured rat hippocampal and cortical neurons .. we examined whether bisphenol a ( bpa ) and 4 - nonylphenol ( np ) influenced staurosporine - induced neuronal cell death in primary cultured rat hippocampal and cortical neurons . in hippocampal neurons , 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) ( 1 nm and 10 microm ) and bpa ( 10 microm ) significantly inhibited the staurosporine - induced release of lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ). in cortical neurons , bpa significantly inhibited the ldh release , while e2 did not . in hippocampal neurons , e2 and bpa significantly inhibited the staurosporine - induced increase in caspase - 3 activity . in cortical neurons , bpa and np significantly inhibited the increase in caspase - 3 activity , while e2 did not . furthermore , low - dose bpa ( 10 nm ) also significantly inhibited the increase in caspase - 3 activity in both hippocampal and cortical neurons . bpa and np might impede normal brain development by inhibiting even desirable neuronal cell death , interfering with caspase - 3 activation .	0

interlayer formation and its effect on debonding polycrystalline alumina orthodontic brackets .. during the debonding of ceramic orthodontic brackets , there is a risk of causing fractures , cracks , or flaking of enamel or of the bracket itself . preliminary work on the resin - enamel interface under bonded brackets with the indirect ( modified thomas ) or the thermal - cured indirect bonding techniques revealed an interlayer of unfilled resin formed between the filled resin and the enamel surface . the direct bonding technique , on the other hand , showed no such layer . this study was designed to determine the effect of the interlayer on conventional debonding techniques for polycrystalline ceramic orthodontic brackets . variables examined were bracket failure or fracture ( bf ), amount of remnant adhesive ( ari ), and enamel damage . brackets were bonded to 90 fresh bovine teeth . these were divided into three groups of 30 each , based on three methods of bonding , i . e ., direct , indirect ( modified thomas ), and an indirect technique that used a thermal - cured resin . each bonding group was further divided into three groups of 10 each , based on the type of debonding technique used , i . e ., lift off , delamination , and twisting . brackets bonded by the indirect ( modified thomas , bf mean = 0 . 27 , ari mean = 0 . 93 ) and the indirect technique that used a thermal - cured resin ( bf mean = 0 . 03 , ari mean = 0 . 43 ) resulted in an overall significantly lower failure ( p < 0 . 01 ) and ari score on debonding ( p < 0 . 0001 ) compared with those bonded by the direct technique ( bf mean = 1 . 03 , ari mean = 1 . 97 ). specimens evaluated under the stereomicroscope revealed that the brackets bonded with the indirect techniques debonded at the filled - unfilled resin interface or within the interlayer of unfilled resin .

spr sensing of bisphenol a using molecularly imprinted nanoparticles immobilized on slab optical waveguide with consecutive parallel au and ag deposition bands coexistent with bisphenol a - immobilized au nanoparticles .. a slab - type optical waveguide ( s_owg )- based microfluidic spr measurement system for bisphenol a was developed . this s_owg possesses consecutive parallel gold and silver deposition bands in the line of plasmon flow , allowing two individual spr signals to be independently obtained as a result of the difference in resonant reflection spectra of these metals . as a molecular recognition element , molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles ( mip - np ) were employed and immobilized on the surface of each of the gold and silver deposition bands . the resonant reflection spectra were measured on the mip - np - immobilized consecutive parallel gold and silver deposition bands coexistent with bpa - aunp . the ag - based spr spectra showed a red shift ( 0 . 7 nm ) when free bpa ( 0 . 1 mm ) was passed over the bpa - aunp / immobilized mip - np complexes formed on the s_owg , unlike the case for the au deposition band , while a large excess of bpa induced a blue shift due to the competitive desorption of bpa - aunp from the immobilized mip - np on the s_owg . by using the proposed detection system , binding events of other small molecules could be monitored in conjunction with the use of mip - np and labeled - aunp .	0
thermal and mechanical interfacial properties of the dgeba / pmr - 15 blend system .. in this work , the blend system of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol a and pmr - 15 polyimide is investigated in terms of thermal and dynamic mechanical interfacial properties of the casting specimens . the thermal stabilities are studied by thermogravimetric and thermomechanical analyses , and the dynamic mechanical properties are carried out by dynamic mechanical analysis . the results show that the thermal stabilities based on the initial decomposition temperature , the integral procedural decomposition temperature , and the glass transition temperature are increased with increasing pmr - 15 content . the crosslinking density ( rho ) of the blend system is increased at 10 phr of pmr - 15 , compared with that of neat epoxy . mechanical interfacial properties measured in the context of critical stress intensity factor and critical strain energy release rate show similar behaviors with e ( a ) and rho , probably due to the increase in intermolecular interactions or hydrogen bondings in polymer chains .	0

effects of in utero and lactational exposure to bisphenol a on somatic growth and anogenital distance in f1 rat offspring .. bisphenol a ( bpa ), a xenoestrogen , has been reported to mimic the actions of estrogen or to affect the endocrine glands in vivo and in vitro . in this study , we examined whether in utero and lactational exposure to bpa altered the somatic growth and anogenital distance ( agd ) of f1 offspring ( 1 , 3 , and 9 weeks of age ) in vivo in rats . dams were orally administered with various doses of bpa ( 0 , 4 , or 40 mg / kg body weight ( bw )/ day ) from gestation day ( gd ) 6 through postnatal day ( pnd ) 20 . there were no significant changes in body weight , liver weight , kidneys weight , testes weight , agd , the ratio of agd to bw , or the ratio of agd to the cube root of bw in bpa exposed pups compared to the vehicle - exposed control . this suggests that prenatal and postnatal exposure ( indirect exposure ) to bpa ( 4 - 40 mg / kg / day , gd 6 - pnd 20 ) does not affect on somatic growth or agd of f1 generation of male and female rats .	0
occurrence and estrogenicity of phenolics in paper - recycling process water : pollutants originating from thermal paper in waste paper .. eight phenolics were detected in samples collected from areas where paper - recycling process water is discharged . the detected concentration levels were up to 270 microg / l and 230 microg / g in water samples and sediment samples , respectively , obtained from both the outfall of the paper - recycling process water and its downstream areas . in particular , totarol ( compound 4 ), 2 , 4 - bis ( 1 - phenylethyl ) phenol ( compound 6 ), 4 , 4 '- butylidenebis ( 6 - t - butyl - m - cresol ) ( compound 7 ), 2 , 4 - bis ( 1 - phenylethyl )- 6 - chlorophenol ( compound 8 ), and 4 - hydroxy - 4 '- isopropoxydiphenyl sulfone ( compound 9 ) were identified for the first time as environmental pollutants . the estrogenicities of the identified compounds were assessed by yeast two - hybrid assays incorporating either the human or medaka fish ( oryzias latipes ) estrogen receptor alpha ( heralpha and mederalpha , respectively ) and an estrogen receptor competitive enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( er - elisa ) both with and without metabolic activation by a rat liver s9 mix . bisphenol a ( compound 3 ) and 2 - naphthol ( compound 1 ) exhibited activity in the assays of both heralpha and mederalpha without the s9 mix . the relative activity (%) to 17beta - estradiol was 0 . 0015 % for compound 3 and 0 . 0009 % for compound 1 in the heralpha assay and 0 . 027 % for compound 3 and 0 . 0093 % for compound 1 in the mederalpha assay . these compounds were attenuated by the s9 mix . the binding affinity was evaluated using an er - elisa . compounds 3 , 4 , 6 , and 7 exhibited affinity without the s9 mix . after exposure to the s9 mix , however , the binding affinity of compound 7 was eliminated by the s9 mix ; those of compounds 3 , 4 , and 6 were attenuated ; and that of compound 8 exhibited affinity . a comprehensive assessment of the estrogenicities of the phenolics originating from thermal paper and their implications for an aquatic environment may require an examination of the components of the phenolics , as in the present study .	0
sulfonic acid functionalized mesoporous mcm - 41 silica as a convenient catalyst for bisphenol - a synthesis .. sulfonic acid groups anchored to the surface of mesoporous mcm - 41 silica have been identified with s k - edge xanes spectra and the material is an efficient catalyst for the liquid phase condensation of phenol with acetone to form bisphenol - a with high selectivity .	0
biodegradation of a dental composite by esterases : dependence on enzyme concentration and specificity .. studies have shown that inflammatory ( cholesterol esterase , ce ) and salivary ( pseudo - cholinesterase , pce ) enzymes can cause the breakdown of bisphenol - a diglycidyl dimethacrylate ( bisgma ) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ) components from composite resins . based on the above consideration , it was desired to show how ce - and pce - catalyzed hydrolysis of resin components was dependent on the enzymes ' concentration and to determine their distinct specificities ( if any ) towards resin components . photopolymerized model composite resin samples ( 60 % weight fraction silanated barium glass filler ) based on bisgma and tegdma monomers ( 55 / 45 weight ratio of the matrix , respectively ) were incubated with pbs and either 0 . 01 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 or 1 unit / ml of ce or pce for 16 days ( ph 7 . 0 , 37 degrees c ). incubation solutions were analyzed by high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ), uv spectroscopy and mass spectrometry . the composite samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ). degradation rates of bisgma and tegdma monomers were assessed . the results showed that ce had a greater specificity towards cleaving bisgma while pce showed a greater specificity towards tegdma . a strong enzyme concentration dependence was observed which suggests that the level of degradation products generated for a material will depend on the esterase make - up of an individual ' s saliva in combination with the specific formulation of monomer components used .	0
effects of beta - estradiol and bisphenol a on heat shock protein levels and localization in the mouse uterus are antagonized by the antiestrogen ici 182 , 780 .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) exhibits many estrogen - like effects in the rodent uterus , but not all of these can be attenuated by antiestrogens . this suggests the involvement of alternate pathways of bpa action that do not involve the estrogen receptor ( er ). an examination of the in vivo effects of bpa on uterine gene expression and protein levels should contribute to an understanding of its mechanism of action . in this study we examined the dose - related effects of bpa on levels of a suite of heat shock proteins ( hsps ) and on the localization of hsp90alpha , a chaperone of the er , in uteri of ovariectomized b6c3f1 mice and compared these effects with those of beta - estradiol ( e2 ). the antiestrogen ici 182 , 780 ( ici ) was co - administered with bpa or e2 in order to examine the potential role of the er . bpa , although less potent than e2 , increased hsp90alpha and grp94 to similar levels , but was much less effective than e2 in increasing levels of hsp72 . treatment with 100 mg bpa / kg / day or 2 microg e2 / kg / day increased hsp90alpha to 300 % of control levels and altered its tissue expression pattern . in uteri of corn oil ( control )- treated mice , hsp90alpha predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nuclei of epithelial cells . upon treatment with bpa or e2 there was increased intensity of staining in the stroma and myometrium , and in the epithelium hsp90alpha was localized almost exclusively in the cytoplasm . the effects of bpa or e2 on hsp levels and hsp90alpha localization were attenuated by ici . these results suggest an involvement of the er in bpa - and e2 - induced increases in uterine levels of hsp90alpha , grp94 , and hsp72 , and localization of hsp90alpha .	0
prenatal exposure to bisphenol a affects adult murine neocortical structure .. prenatal exposure to low - doses of bisphenol a ( bpa ) has been shown to affect murine neocortical development by accelerating neuronal differentiation / migration through disrupting thyroid hormone function . we therefore studied whether prenatal exposure to low - doses of bpa affected organization of adult neocortical structures . pregnant mice were injected with 20 microg / kg of bpa daily from embryonic day 0 . 5 ( e0 . 5 ) and bromodeoxyuridine ( brdu ) was injected at e12 . 5 , e14 . 5 and at e16 . 5 , and the fetal brains were analyzed after birth . the brdu - positive cells labeled at e14 . 5 were significantly increased in the vth and vith cortical layers of bpa - treated mice at postnatal 3 weeks ( p3w ), whereas they were confined to the ivth layer of control mice , though such differences disappeared at p12w . the thalamocortical projections demonstrated by dii - labeling were abnormal at p3w and p12w in bpa - treated mice . these results indicate that bpa might affect not only neocortical development but also thalamocortical connections .	0
a 36 - month clinical evaluation of ethanol / water and acetone - based etch - and - rinse adhesives in non - carious cervical lesions .. unlabelled : this double - blind randomized clinical trial compared different ethanol / water and acetone - based systems in non - carious cervical lesions over 36 months . materials and methods : eighty - four patients having at least one non - carious cervical lesion [ nccl ] under occlusion were enrolled in this study . a total of 84 restorations were placed , half for each group ( adper single bond [ sb ] + filteka110 or one step [ os ] + micronew ). all the materials were placed by two calibrated operators . two other independent examiners evaluated the restorations at baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 and 36 months , according to slightly modified usphs criteria . statistical analysis between materials in each period was conducted using the fisher ' s exact test ( alpha = 0 . 05 ), and performance of the materials in the baseline in comparison to each period was evaluated by mcnemar ' s test ( alpha = 0 . 05 ). results : the 12 -, 18 - and 36 - month retention rates for sb were 95 . 2 % ( 12 and 18 months ) and 92 . 3 % ( 36 months ). for os , the retention rates were 83 . 3 %, 73 . 8 % and 56 . 4 %, respectively , for each recall period . after 36 months , 10 os restorations ( 25 . 7 %) and seven sb restorations ( 17 . 9 %) were rated as bravo in the marginal discoloration item . conclusions : the ethanol / water - based adhesive ( single bond ) that was evaluated showed a higher retention rate than the acetone - based system ( one step ) after 36 months of clinical service .	0
ligand structure - dependent activation of estrogen receptor alpha / sp by estrogens and xenoestrogens .. this study investigated the effects of e2 , diethylstilbestrol ( des ), antiestrogens , the phytoestrogen resveratrol , and the xenoestrogens octylphenol ( op ), nonylphenol ( np ), endosulfan , kepone , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 - tetrachlorobiphenyl - 4 - ol ( ho - pcb - cl ( 4 )), bisphenol - a ( bpa ), and 2 , 2 - bis -( p - hydroxyphenyl )- 1 , 1 , 1 - trichloroethane ( hpte ) on induction of luciferase activity in breast cancer cells transfected with a construct ( psp1 ( 3 )) containing three tandem gc - rich sp binding sites linked to luciferase and wild - type or variant eralpha . the results showed that induction of luciferase activity was highly structure - dependent in both mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells . moreover , rna interference assays using small inhibitory rnas for sp1 , sp3 and sp4 also demonstrated structure - dependent differences in activation of eralpha / sp1 , eralpha / sp3 and eralpha / sp4 . these results demonstrate for the first time that various structural classes of er ligands differentially activate wild - type and variant eralpha / sp - dependent transactivation , selectively use different sp proteins , and exhibit selective er modulator ( serm )- like activity .	0
defined plant extracts can protect human cells against combined xenobiotic effects .. background : pollutants representative of common environmental contaminants induce intracellular toxicity in human cells , which is generally amplified in combinations . we wanted to test the common pathways of intoxication and detoxification in human embryonic and liver cell lines . we used various pollutants such as roundup residues , bisphenol - a and atrazine , and five precise medicinal plant extracts called circ1 , dig1 , dig2 , sp1 , and uro1 in order to understand whether specific molecular actions took place or not . methods : kidney and liver are major detoxification organs . we have studied embryonic kidney and hepatic human cell lines e293 and hepg2 . the intoxication was induced on the one hand by a formulation of one of the most common herbicides worldwide , roundup 450 gt + ( glyphosate and specific adjuvants ), and on the other hand by a mixture of bisphenol - a and atrazine , all found in surface waters , feed and food . the prevention and curative effects of plant extracts were also measured on mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity , on the entry of radiolabelled glyphosate ( in roundup ) in cells , and on cytochromes p450 1a2 and 3a4 as well as glutathione - s - transferase . results : clear toxicities of pollutants were observed on both cell lines at very low sub - agricultural dilutions . the prevention of such phenomena took place within 48 h with the plant extracts tested , with success rates ranging between 25 - 34 % for the e293 intoxicated by roundup , and surprisingly up to 71 % for the hepg2 . by contrast , after intoxication , no plant extract was capable of restoring e293 viability within 48 h , however , two medicinal plant combinations did restore the bisphenol - a / atrazine intoxicated hepg2 up to 24 - 28 %. the analysis of underlying mechanisms revealed that plant extracts were not capable of preventing radiolabelled glyphosate from entering cells ; however dig2 did restore the cyp1a2 activity disrupted by roundup , and had only a mild preventive effect on the cyp3a4 , and no effect on the glutathione s - transferase . conclusions : environmental pollutants have intracellular effects that can be prevented , or cured in part , by precise medicinal plant extracts in two human cell lines . this appears to be mediated at least in part by the cytochromes p450 modulation .	0
comparison of the marginal integrity of in vivo and in vitro class ii composite restorations .. in the present study class ii resin composite restorations were placed under in vivo and in vitro conditions . for the in vivo part . class ii preparations were cut in teeth destined for extraction for orthodontic reasons . the preparations were completed with the gingival margin in enamel and restored using six different combinations restorative techniques and materials . the teeth were extracted after 4 - 6 weeks . in the in vitro part similar preparations were cut in extracted teeth and restored using the selected material - technique combinations . the in vitro specimens were thermocycled and mechanically loaded at 125 n for a total of 4000 cycles . all in vivo and in vitro samples were stored in a dye solution , sectioned and inspected for microleakage . microleakage was observed in all the in vivo specimens with only 60 % of the in vitro specimens demonstrating microleakage . these results indicate the limitation of laboratory investigations in predicting the microleakage performance of class ii composite resin restorations under clinical circumstances .	0
[ determination of alkylphenols , bisphenol a , benzophenone and phthalates in containers of baby food , and migration into food simulants ].. infants , whose growth and development are highly dependent upon the endocrine system , are particularly vulnerable to endocrine disruptor exposure . in our study , we examined whether or not alkylphenols , bisphenol a , benzophenone , di ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) adipate and 10 phthalates are present in containers of baby food . furthermore , the migration into food - simulating solvents was also examined . sixteen types of containers of baby food , obtained on the japanese market in 2001 , were examined : 8 glass bottle types , 1 plastic type , 1 metallic package ( laminated with plastic ) and 6 multilayered laminated film packages . alkylphenols , benzophenone , bisphenol a and di ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) adipate were not detected in any of the samples . on the other hand , dibutylphthalate ( dbp ) was detected in 7 samples ( 1 . 2 - 9 . 1 micrograms / sample ), and di ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) was detected in 15 samples ( 1 . 3 - 18 micrograms / sample ). migration tests were carried out for 5 samples , and the levels of dbp and dehp that migrated into n - heptane were 0 . 68 - 1 . 7 micrograms / sample and 0 . 33 - 3 . 5 micrograms / sample , respectively . from these results , a baby ' s intake levels of dbp and dehp were estimated to be about 1 / 2 , 500 and 1 / 90 - 300 of the tolerable daily intake ( tdi ), respectively .	0
endocrine disruptors and asthma - associated chemicals in consumer products .. background : laboratory and human studies raise concerns about endocrine disruption and asthma resulting from exposure to chemicals in consumer products . limited labeling or testing information is available to evaluate products as exposure sources . objectives : we analytically quantified endocrine disruptors and asthma - related chemicals in a range of cosmetics , personal care products , cleaners , sunscreens , and vinyl products . we also evaluated whether product labels provide information that can be used to select products without these chemicals . methods : we selected 213 commercial products representing 50 product types . we tested 42 composited samples of high - market - share products , and we tested 43 alternative products identified using criteria expected to minimize target compounds . analytes included parabens , phthalates , bisphenol a ( bpa ), triclosan , ethanolamines , alkylphenols , fragrances , glycol ethers , cyclosiloxanes , and ultraviolet ( uv ) filters . results : we detected 55 compounds , indicating a wide range of exposures from common products . vinyl products contained > 10 % bis ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) and could be an important source of dehp in homes . in other products , the highest concentrations and numbers of detects were in the fragranced products ( e . g ., perfume , air fresheners , and dryer sheets ) and in sunscreens . some products that did not contain the well - known endocrine - disrupting phthalates contained other less - studied phthalates ( dicyclohexyl phthalate , diisononyl phthalate , and di - n - propyl phthalate ; also endocrine - disrupting compounds ), suggesting a substitution . many detected chemicals were not listed on product labels . conclusions : common products contain complex mixtures of edcs and asthma - related compounds . toxicological studies of these mixtures are needed to understand their biological activity . regarding epidemiology , our findings raise concern about potential confounding from co - occurring chemicals and misclassification due to variability in product composition . consumers should be able to avoid some target chemicals - synthetic fragrances , bpa , and regulated active ingredients - using purchasing criteria . more complete product labeling would enable consumers to avoid the rest of the target chemicals .	0
perinatal bisphenol a exposure increases estrogen sensitivity of the mammary gland in diverse mouse strains .. background : studies of low - dose effects of xenoestrogens have yielded conflicting results that may be attributed to differences in estrogen sensitivity between the rodent strains examined . perinatal exposure of cd - 1 mice to low doses of the xenoestrogen bisphenol a ( bpa ) alters peripubertal mammary gland development . future studies to assess the role of estrogen receptors as mediators of bpa action require estrogen receptor knock - out mice that were generated on a c57bl6 background . the sensitivity of the c57bl6 strain to estradiol and bpa is unknown . objectives : in the present study we examined whether the mammary glands of cd - 1 and c57bl6 mice exhibited similar responses to 17beta - estradiol ( e ( 2 )) and whether perinatal exposure to bpa equally enhanced sensitivity of the mammary glands to e ( 2 ) at puberty . methods : immature mice were ovariectomized and treated for 10 days with one of eight doses of e ( 2 ). morphological mammary gland parameters were examined to identify doses producing half - maximal effects . mice were exposed perinatally to 0 or 250 ng bpa / kg body weight ( bw )/ day from gestational day 8 until postnatal day ( pnd ) 2 . on pnd25 , female offspring were ovariectomized and given an estrogen challenge of 0 , 0 . 5 , or 1 microg e ( 2 )/ kg bw / day for 10 days . morphometric parameters of the mammary gland were compared between strains . results : both strains exhibited similar responses to e ( 2 ). perinatal bpa exposure altered responses to e ( 2 ) at puberty for several parameters in both strains , although the effect in cd - 1 was slightly more pronounced . conclusion : both mouse strains provide adequate models for the study of perinatal exposure to xenoestrogens .	0
comparison of microleakage of composite restorations using fifth and sixth generation dentin bonding agent : an in vivo study .. introduction : the success of bonded restorations depends on effective bonding between restorative materials and tooth structure , and it prevents microleakage . new dentin bonding systems have been introduced which promotes this concept . the aim of this study was to compare the amount of microleakage between ' single bond ' vs ' prompt l - pop ' during different time periods . materials and methods : in this clinical trial study , 60 nonretentive class five cavities were prepared on buccal surfaces of human premolars which were scheduled to be removed for orthodontic purposes . the cavities were restored using two different bonding agents ; fifth generation ( single bond ) and sixth generation ( prompt l - pop ) and then filled with resin composite ( filtek z - 250 ). the samples in both groups were extracted after placing the restoration in three periods of time : immediately , 1 week and 6 months postplacement . specimens were sealed with two layers of nail varnish except for 1 mm around restoration and immersed in a silver nitrate solution for 24 hours . the teeth were then sectioned longitudinally and the degree of microleakage was determined by stereomicroscope based on standard usual criteria . results : single bond showed more leakage at dentin margin than enamel margin in all three extraction periods and differences were significant among three groups ( p < 0 . 05 ). in samples which were restored with prompt l - pop only in groups of 6 months there were significant differences between enamel and dentin margins . at enamel margin there were no significant differences between microleakage of groups according to the passage of time ( p > 0 . 05 ). conclusion : the results of this study using two different bonding systems , indicate that adhesion to enamel was more valuable than dentin and perhaps systems that include self - etching primers are less sensitive to remaining moisture on dentin and they are less affected during different time periods .	0
[ resin adhesion on the primary ground enamel . ( 2 ) influence of the etched enamel ].. the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the etching times on the adhesion of the resin on the primary ground enamel . fifty extracted and frozen bovine mandibular primary incisors were used . the etchant used in this study was 37 % phospholic acid gel and the etching times were 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 and 60 seconds . all of the specimens were washed with an air water spray after etching . the bonding agent and composite resin used in this study were dual cured scotch bond and silux ( 3m co .). shear bond strengths on the ground enamel were measured . after the shear bond strength test , all the test surfaces of the enamel and resin specimens were observed using the sem . the results of this study were compared with the previous results using photo bond and photo clearifil a ( kurarey co .). 1 ) the etching time which showed the highest bond strength was 20 seconds ( 76 . 77 +/- 12 . 99 mpa ). 2 ) when the enamel was etched with all of the etching times , the bond strength were significantly higher than that of the enamel without etching ( p less than 0 . 01 ). 3 ) in the etched groups , there was no significant difference among the bond strengths with all of the etching times categories . 4 ) in the etched groups , the longer the etching times , the lower the standard deviations were . 5 ) on the enamel specimens after the shear bond strength test , the frequency of the resin tags fractured inside of the enamel prisms was higher in the group which showed a lower bond strength . 6 ) for the same etching times , significant difference between the bond strengths of silux and those of photo clearfil a was obtained only with the 20 seconds of etching time ( p less than 0 . 01 ) and the bond strength of silux was higher .	0
prenatal and neonatal exposure to bisphenol - a affects the morphine - induced rewarding effect and hyperlocomotion in mice .. bisphenol - a ( bpa ), one of the most common environmental endocrine disrupters , has been extensively evaluated for toxicity and carcinogenicity . however , little is still known about its action on the cns . here we found that prenatal and neonatal exposure to bpa resulted in the enhancement of the rewarding effect and hyperlocomotion induced by morphine in mice . under these conditions , no change in the g - protein activation by morphine and mu - opioid receptor expression in the lower midbrain was observed by prenatal and neonatal exposure to bpa . these results suggest that chronic exposure to bpa produces the supersensitivity of the morphine - induced rewarding effect and hyperlocomotion without direct changes in mu - opioid receptor function in the lower midbrain . the present data provide further evidence that prenatal and neonatal exposure to bpa can directly influence the development of the central dopaminergic system .	0
microleakage of porcelain veneer restorations bonded to enamel and dentin with a new self - adhesive resin - based dental cement .. unlabelled : cementation technique of bonded ceramic restorations is a time - consuming and technique - sensitive procedure critical to long - term success . objective : evaluate the performance of a self - adhesive , modified - resin dental cement ( rely - x unicem , 3m - espe ) for the cementation of ceramic veneer restorations without previous conditioning of the tooth surface , and in combination with a one - bottle adhesive and a self - etching adhesive . methods : thirty - six premolars received a veneer preparation that extended into dentin . leucite - reinforced pressed glass ceramic ( empress 1 ) veneers were cemented following manufacturers ' instructions , according to the following treatment groups ( n = 9 ): ( 1 ) variolink - excite ivoclar - vivadent ( v + e control ), ( 2 ) unicem + single bond 3m - espe ( u + sb ), ( 3 ) unicem + adper prompt l - pop 3m - espe ( u + ap ), ( 4 ) unicem 3m - espe ( u ). after 24h storage at 37 degrees c , teeth were thermocycled ( 2000 cycles ) at 5 and 55 degrees c , immersed in ammoniacal silver nitrate for 24h , placed in a developer solution overnight and sectioned using a slow - speed saw . three 1mm longitudinal sections were obtained from each tooth and evaluated for leakage with a microscope ( 1x to 4x ). imaging software was used to measure stain penetration along the dentin and enamel surfaces . results : anova with snk ( alpha = 0 . 05 ) revealed that on dentin , u had significantly less leakage than u + sb and u + ap , but no different than v + e ; on enamel u had leakage values that were significantly greater than the groups with adhesives . significance : the self - adhesive cement u gave low leakage on dentin that was comparable to the cement that employed an adhesive for sealing dentin , whereas this cement benefits from use of an adhesive when cementing to enamel .	0
effect of salivary contamination on the bond strength of total - etch and self - etch adhesive systems : an in vitro study .. aim : to evaluate the influence of salivary contamination during dentin bonding procedures on shear bond strength and to investigate the effect of contaminant - removing treatments on the recovery of bond strength for two dentin - bonding agents . materials and methods : seventy - seven human maxillary and mandibular molars were randomly divided into two groups for total - etch adhesive ( single bond - 3m espe , usa ) and self - etch primer ( unifil bond - gc , tokyo , japan ) and subjected to contamination with saliva . the data for each group were subjected to one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by the student newman - keuls test to make comparisons among the groups ( p < 0 . 05 ). results : salivary contamination had less adverse effect on the shear bond strength of single bond total - etch adhesive when it was blot dried or washed . unifil bond was tolerant of salivary contamination , except when contamination occurred after application of the primer . conclusion : in single bond adhesive , when the etched surface is contaminated by saliva , blotting the surface and applying the primer can recover the bond strength . complete drying of the salivary contaminated surface should be avoided . in the unifil bond groups , the repriming treatment ( uf - v and uf - vi ) resulted in the recovery of shear bond strength in the specimens contaminated after priming . clinical significance : the results of this study showed that total - etch adhesive ( single bond ) was not affected by salivary contamination on the etched surface when the bonding surface was kept moist . self - etch adhesive ( unifil bond ) also tolerated salivary contamination except when the contamination occurred after application of the primer .	0
biodegradation of bisphenol - a in river sediment .. this research investigated the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of bisphenol - a ( bpa ) in river sediment . with the addition of 250 μg g ⁻ ¹ bpa , the percentages of bpa remaining in sediment from sites a , b , and c were 21 . 9 %, 3 . 5 % and 12 . 5 %, respectively , after 5 days of incubation under aerobic conditions ; degradation was not significant after 140 days of incubation under anaerobic conditions . the aerobic degradation of bpa was enhanced by adding yeast extract ( 5 mg l ⁻ ¹ ), sodium chloride ( 1 %), cellulose ( 0 . 96 mg l ⁻ ¹ ), brij 30 ( 55 μm ), brij 35 ( 91 μm ), rhamnolipid ( 130 mg l ⁻ ¹ ), or surfactin ( 43 mg l ⁻ ¹ ), with rhamnolipid yielding higher bpa degradation than the other additives . 2 , 4 - bis ( 1 , 1 - dimethyl ethyl ) phenol , an intermediate product resulting from the aerobic degradation of bpa was accumulated in sediments . of the bacterial strains isolated from the sediment , strains j1 , j2 , j3 , and j4 expressed the best aerobic degrading ability . the highest bpa degradation rate was found in the sediment by the addition of strains j1 , j2 , j3 , and j4 combined , whereas the sediment without the addition of the 4 strains had the lowest biodegradation rate . this research offers feasible methods for the removal of bpa in river sediment for bioremediation .	0
[ study on adsorption of bisphenol a from aqueous solution on modified activated carbons ].. a commercial activated carbon ( wv a1100 ) was modified with nitric acid , sodium hydroxide and thermal treatment in an atmosphere of n2 . several techniques were used to characterize the physicochemical properties of these materials including bet , xps , ph ( pzc ) and boehm titration . the results indicated that the specific surface area of the w20 remarkably decreased after oxidized by nitric acid . but the amount of surface acidic oxygen - containing functional groups of the oxidized sample increased compared to the w20 and resulting in the points of zero charge ( ph ( pzc )) changed from 4 . 95 to 1 . 50 . the changes of surface chemical properties of thermal treatment and sodium hydroxide treatment were opposite to the oxidized sample , as a result , the ph ( pzc ) of them was changed to near ph 7 . 0 . however , a 43 . 81 % surface area of w20 was also diminished by thermal treatment . furthermore , the results of bpa adsorption indicated that the oligomerization of bpa on the surface of activated carbon could not be formed through oxidative coupling reactions in the presence of dissolved oxygen . and the data of bpa adsorption on original sample , thermal and sodium hydroxide treatment sample were fitted to the langmuir isotherm model well . whereas the freundlich isotherm model described the adsorptive behavior of the oxidized sample better . in addition , the adsorption capacity of thermal treatment sample was the highest and its saturated adsorption capacity reached 526 . 32 mg / g . the value was three times higher than that of the oxidized sample . combined with the results of characterization , it was found that the hydrophobic nature and zero of net charge density of carbon surface were the main factors to affect the bpa adsorption on activated carbons and the adsorption is based on pi - pi theory .	0

serum bisphenol a concentrations showed gender differences , possibly linked to androgen levels .. to investigate human exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ), a widely used endocrine disruptor , we measured serum bpa concentrations and analyzed the interrelation of bpa with sex - related hormones . bpa was detected in all human sera by a novel enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay . serum bpa concentrations were significantly higher in normal men ( 1 . 49 +/- 0 . 11 ng / ml ; p < 0 . 01 ) and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( 1 . 04 +/- 0 . 10 ng / ml ; p < 0 . 05 ) compared with normal women ( 0 . 64 +/- 0 . 10 ng / ml ). there were significant positive correlations between serum bpa and total testosterone ( r = 0 . 595 , p < 0 . 001 ) and free testosterone ( r = 0 . 609 , p < 0 . 001 ) concentrations in all subjects and likewise between serum bpa and total testosterone ( r = 0 . 559 , p < 0 . 01 ) and free testosterone ( r = 0 . 598 , p < 0 . 001 ) concentrations in all female subjects , but not between serum bpa and other sex - related hormone concentrations in any group . these findings showed that there are gender differences in serum bpa concentrations , possibly due to differences in the androgen - related metabolism of bpa .	0
the effect of three silane coupling agents and their blends with a cross - linker silane on bonding a bis - gma resin to silicatized titanium ( a novel silane system ).. objectives : three activated organofunctional silane coupling agents alone and blended with a non - functional cross - linker silane were evaluated as adhesion promoters in an experiment where a bis - gma ( bis - phenol - a - diglycidyldimethacrylate ) resin was bonded to silicatized titanium . the adhesive performances of the silanes were assessed as shear bond strength values . materials and methods : 3 - methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane , n -[ 3 -( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl ] ethylenediamine and [ 3 -( triethoxysilyl ) propyl ] urea were prepared as 1 . 0vol .% solutions in 95 vol .% ethanol . they were each also blended with 1 . 0 vol .% 1 , 2 - bis -( triethoxysilyl ) ethane solutions that were activated for 1 or 24 h . titanium slides were cleaned , silicatized , distributed randomly to study groups and silanized with nine silane solutions . after silanization experimental bis - gma resin stubs were photo - polymerized and post - polymerized in a light - curing unit . the shear bond strength was measured as ' dry samples ' and after thermo - cycling ( 6000 cycles at 5 - 55 degrees c ). results : the type of silane affected significantly the shear bond strength ( p < 0 . 001 ) and the use of cross - linker silane ( p < 0 . 005 ) according to the statistical analysis ( anova ). it showed that the highest shear bond strength for thermo - cycled resin stub samples ( n = 8 / group ) was obtained with a blend of 1 . 0vol .% 3 - methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane + 1 . 0 vol .% 1 , 2 - bis -( triethoxysilyl ) ethane blend ( 10 . 4 +/- 3 . 5 mpa ). the lowest results were obtained with 1 . 0 vol .% [ 3 -( triethoxysilyl ) propyl ] urea ( 4 . 5 +/- 1 . 0 mpa ), and with 1 . 0 vol .% n -[ 3 -( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl ] ethylenediamine ( 4 . 5 +/- 1 . 4 mpa ). conclusions : silanization with a blend of a functional silane and a cross - linker silane ( a novel silane system ) might improve the hydrolytic stability of a siloxane film between silicatized titanium and a bis - gma resin .	0
an evaluation of polishing agents for composite resins .. after the gross reduction and fine finishing of a composite resin restoration , selecting a system to create the smoothest polish is difficult because high magnification is necessary to compare the surface roughness . the surfaces of four anterior and posterior composite resins were compared using a mylar strip , an unfilled resin as a glaze , polishing with three rubber polishers , and three different manufacturers ' series of disks . this study suggested that pairing a specific composite resin with a matching polishing system produced the smoothest surface . because of the differences in the size , shape , number of filler particles , and the type of resin , one system was incapable of creating the smoothest surface for all composite resins .	0
the effect of estrogen compounds on human embryoid bodies .. human embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryo at the blastocyst stage and their differentiation occurs through an intermediate step involving the formation of embryoid bodies ( ebs ), which are aggregates of embryonic stem cells . the ebs seem to be a powerful tool for investigating the development of embryos , as they can mimic the initial stages of embryonic development . in this study , we aimed to investigate the effect of estrogen compounds on the proliferation and differentiation of short - term and long - term cultured ebs in vitro . for this study , 10 - day - old ( short - term cultured ) and 30 - day - old ( long - term cultured ) ebs were subjected to estradiol ( e2 ), estriol ( e3 ), selective estrogen receptor modulator ( raloxifene [ rlx ]), bisphenol a , and 1 , 3 , 5 - tris ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl )- 4 - propyl - 1h - pyrazole for 7 days . to confirm the effects of estrogen treatment , ici - 182780 was added to the respective ebs for additional 7 days following estrogen treatment . quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze the relative expression of differentiation marker genes representing the 3 germ layers . the expression of 7 marker genes , which included α - fetoprotein , hepatocyte nuclear factor ( hnf )- 3β , hnf - 4α ( endoderm ), brachyury , cardiac actin ([ cact ]; mesoderm ), nestin ( ectoderm ), and oct - 4 ( undifferentiated ), was measured . significantly , lower expression of hnf - 4α in both short - term and long - term cultured ebs was observed after treatment of estrogen compounds compared to control . the expression of hnf - 3β in short - term cultured ebs has been positively affected by e2 , e3 , and rlx . regarding cact , higher expression was observed after treatment of e2 ( 10 (- 7 ) mol / l ) and e3 ( 10 (- 9 ) mol / l ) in short - term cultured ebs , but opposite effects were demonstrated in long - term cultured ebs . the lower expressions of hnf - 4α by e2 and rlx were negated by ici - 182780 treatment , although these findings were not statistically significant in e3 - treated group . these findings suggest that estrogen compounds have effects on endodermal and mesodermal differentiation of human ebs .	0

bisphenol a exposure during adulthood causes augmentation of follicular atresia and luteal regression by decreasing 17β - estradiol synthesis via downregulation of aromatase in rat ovary .. background : bisphenol a ( bpa ) has been detected in human body fluids , such as serum and ovarian follicular fluids . several reports indicated that bpa exposure is associated with the occurrence of several female reproductive diseases resulting from the disruption of steroid hormone biosynthesis in the adult ovary . objective : we hypothesized that long - term exposure to low concentrations of bpa disrupts 17β - estradiol ( e2 ) production in granulosa cells via an alteration of steroidogenic proteins in ovarian cells . methods : adult female rats received bpa for 90 days by daily gavage at doses of 0 , 0 . 001 , or 0 . 1 mg / kg body weight . we determined serum levels of e2 , testosterone ( t ), follicle - stimulating hormone ( fsh ), and luteinizing hormone ( lh ). we also analyzed the expressions of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ( star ), p450 side - chain cleavage ( p450scc ), 3β - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isomerase ( 3β - hsd ), and aromatase cytochrome p450 ( p450arom ) in the ovary . results : exposure to bpa significantly decreased e2 serum concentration , which was accompanied by augmented follicular atresia and luteal regression via increase of caspase - 3 - associated apoptosis in ovarian cells . after bpa exposure , p450arom and star protein levels were significantly decreased in granulosa cells and theca - interstitial ( t - i ) cells , respectively . however , p450scc and 3β - hsd protein levels remained unchanged . the increase in lh levels appeared to be associated with the decreased synthesis of t in t - i cells after bpa exposure via homeostatic positive feedback regulation . conclusions : bpa exposure during adulthood can disturb the maintenance of normal ovarian functions by reducing e2 . the steroidogenic proteins star and p450arom appear to be targeted by bpa .	0
effect of in - office bleaching agents on physical properties of dental composite resins .. objectives : the physical properties of dental restorative materials have a crucial effect on the longevity of restorations and moreover on the esthetic demands of patients , but they may be compromised by bleaching treatments . the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of in - office bleaching agents on the physical properties of three composite resin restorative materials . method and materials : the bleaching agents used were hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide at high concentrations . specimens of each material were prepared , cured , and polished . measurements of color difference , microhardness , and surface roughness were recorded before and after bleaching and data were examined statistically by analysis of variance ( anova ) and tukey hsd post - hoc test at p < . 05 . results : the measurements showed that hue and chroma of silorane - based composite resin altered after the bleaching procedure ( p < . 05 ). no statistically significant differences were found when testing the microhardness and surface roughness of composite resins tested ( p > . 05 ). conclusion : the silorane - based composite resin tested showed some color alteration after bleaching procedures . the bleaching procedure did not alter the microhardness and the surface roughness of all composite resins tested .	0
evaluation of methylene lactone monomers in dental resins .. alpha - methylene - gamma - butyrolactone ( mbl ), which can be described as the cyclic analog of methyl methacrylate , exhibits greater reactivity in free radical polymerizations than conventional methacrylate monomers . unfilled resin formulations composed of bis - gma / mbl or bis - gma / tegdma / mbl were light - cured . the effect of the more reactive methylene lactone monomer on mechanical properties and the degree of conversion of the polymers was examined . the infrared absorption bands for the carbon - carbon double bonds of mbl and the methacrylate monomers are well resolved and allow the conversion of each component to be calculated individually . the incorporation of a small amount of mbl ( 5 w / o ) to bis - gma significantly increased the conversion ; however , additional mbl ( 10 to 30 w / o ) did not further increase the bis - gma conversion level . this appears to indicate an incompatibility between mbl and the bulky bis - gma monomer . addition of 10 w / o mbl to bis - gma / tegdma ( 7 : 3 ) resulted in a cured resin with 71 % methacrylate and 75 % overall conversion efficiencies compared with the 57 % conversion of the control formulation . the diametral tensile and the transverse strengths were approximately 10 % greater for the mbl resin compared with the bis - gma / tegdma control ; however , these differences were not statistically significant . the synthesis and polymerization of several substituted methylene lactones was also studied .	0
rising hypospadias rates : disproving a myth .. hypospadias is one of the most common congenital abnormalities occurring in males . in recent years , the prevalence of hypospadias and whether that prevalence is rising or stable has become part of a larger debate over the potential effects of so - called ' endocrine disruptors ', such as phthalates and bisphenol - a , on male reproductive health . this commentary critically examines allegations suggesting a worldwide increase in hypospadias rates . despite the lack of scientific support for this hypothesis and for related claims that the disorders of male reproductive health are related to endocrine disruptors , these constructs remain firmly entrenched in popular literature , and are being used in part to justify litigation banning suspected endocrine disruptors such as phthalates and bisphenol - a . a review of the epidemiologic data on this issue amassed to date clearly demonstrates that the bulk of evidence refutes claims for an increase in hypospadias rates . this suggests that two of the three components of alleged testicular dysfunction syndrome , i . e . decline in sperm counts and rise in urogenital anomalies , lack clinical support . it further suggests that extrapolations from data derived in laboratory animal studies about alleged occult risks to humans of various candidate compounds are unwarranted at this time .	0
[ effects of perinatal exposure to bisphenol a inducing dopaminergic neuronal cell to apoptosis happening in midbrain of male rat offspring ].. objective : to investigate the mechanism and effect of rat perinatal exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) resulting in midbrain dopaminergic neuronal cell apoptosis and tyrosine hydroxylase expression of male offspring . methods : rat dams were randomly divided into 4 groups on gestational day ( gd ) 10 and given orally the bisphenol a doses as 0 , 0 . 5 , 5 , 50 mg / kg x d from gd10 to weaning . the brains of male offspring were obtained for detecting , with immunohistochemistry protocol , the caspase - 3 , bcl - 2 and tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the midbrain on postnatal day 21 or 30 respectively , and the midbrain apoptotic neuronal cell were detected by tunel on pnd21 . results : the expression of caspase - 3 in the midbrain of rat male offspring were increased but bcl - 2 were decreased on pnd21 and 30 , respectively . on pnd21 , apoptotic neuronal cell were found in the midbrain of high and medium doses groups . th protein expression was decreased . conclusion : perinatal exposure to bisphenol a can induce the apoptosis of midbrain dopaminergic neuron in the male rat offspring even after weaning , and concomitantly decrease the midbrain th immunoreactivity , this may cause the abnormal function of dopaminergic pathway of rat male offspring .	0
assessing composite resin wear in primary molars : four - year findings .. many investigators have reported minimal wear of resin restorations in primary molars . until recently , quantitative wear assessments have not been reported . the purpose of this investigation was ( 1 ) to present and contrast data from two 48 - month clinical trials wherein quantitative wear assessments were used to evaluate wear of resin restorations in primary molars , and ( 2 ) to compare these results with those using the usphs method of wear assessment . the data were collected from two different clinical trials . one was conducted at the university of california in san francisco by tonn and ryge ( tr trial ). the other was conducted at the university of north carolina at chapel hill by oldenburg , vann , and dilley ( ovd trial ). the ovd trial had a sample size of 45 patients with 106 restorations ; the tr trial had 44 patients with 96 restorations . the restorations in both trials were class i and ii restorations in occlusion . they were placed with the experimental light - cured posterior composite resin f - 70 , later marketed as ful - fill . at baseline , six , 12 , 24 , 36 , and 48 months , restorations were evaluated by two evaluators trained in usphs criteria as well as by a quantitative method of wear assessment , the standard cast technique as described by leinfelder . interstudy comparisons were made by chi - square tests ( usphs evaluations ) and anova ( quantitative assessments ). the results showed that resin restorations in primary molars exhibited progressive wear with time in service . the rate and quantity of wear were very similar to those seen in permanent posterior teeth over 36 months . findings agree with previous reports that the usphs evaluation criteria are insensitive in detecting early wear in primary molars .	0
"""metabolism and kinetics of bisphenol a in humans at low doses following oral administration .. bisphenol a is a widely used industrial chemical with many potential sources of human exposure . bisphenol a is a weak estrogen and has been implicated as an """" endocrine disruptor """". this term is used for a variety of chemicals encountered in the environment which have estrogenic activity . it has been postulated that human exposure to these chemicals may elicit unwanted estrogenic effects in humans such as reduced fertility , altered development and cancer . up to now the body burden of bisphenol a in humans is unknown . therefore , we investigated the metabolism and toxicokinetics of bisphenol a in humans exposed to low doses since systemic bioavailability has a major influence on possible estrogenic effects in vivo . human subjects ( three males and three females , and four males for detailed description of blood kinetics ) were administered d ( 16 )- bisphenol a ( 5 mg ). blood and urine samples were taken in intervals ( up to 96 h ), metabolites formed were identified by gc / ms and lc - ms / ms and quantified by gc / ms - nci and lc - ms / ms . d ( 16 )- bisphenol a glucuronide was the only metabolite of d ( 16 )- bisphenol a detected in urine and blood samples , and concentrations of free d ( 16 )- bisphenol a were below the limit of detection both in urine ( 6 nm ) and blood samples ( 10 nm ). d ( 16 )- bisphenol a glucuronide was cleared from human blood and excreted with urine with terminal half - lives of less than 6 h ; the applied doses were completely recovered in urine as d ( 16 )- bisphenol a glucuronide . maximum blood levels of d ( 16 )- bisphenol a glucuronide ( approximately 800 nm ) were measured 80 min after oral administration of d ( 16 )- bisphenol a ( 5 mg ). the obtained data indicate major species differences in the disposition of bisphenol a . enterohepatic circulation of bisphenol a glucuronide in rats results in a slow rate of excretion , whereas bisphenol a is rapidly conjugated and excreted by humans due to the absence of enterohepatic circulation . the efficient glucuronidation of bisphenol a and the rapid excretion of the formed glucuronide result in a low body burden of the estrogenic bisphenol a in humans following oral absorption of low doses ."""	0
circulating levels of bisphenol a ( bpa ) and phthalates in an elderly population in sweden , based on the prospective investigation of the vasculature in uppsala seniors ( pivus ).. the plastic manufacture compounds , bisphenol a ( bpa ) and phthalates , are ubiquitous and have therefore been detected in virtually all types of analyzed human samples . the aim of this study was : ( 1 ) to investigate concentrations of serum levels of bpa and phthalate metabolites in seniors residing in the city of uppsala , sweden ( 2 ) to evaluate gender differences in relation to serum levels of bpa and phthalate metabolites in the subjects . in the population - based prospective investigation of the vasculature in uppsala seniors ( pivus ), encompassing 1016 subjects , all aged 70 , serum levels of bpa and phthalate metabolites were measured by isotope dilution - high performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry . bpa and four out of ten phthalate metabolites , namely , monoisobutyl phthalate ( mibp ), monomethyl phthalate ( mmp ), monoethyl phthalate ( mep ), mono -( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( mehp ), were detectable in almost all subjects . of the remaining phthalate metabolites , monobenzyl phthalate ( mbzp ), mono -( 2 - ethyl - 5 - hydroxyhexyl ) phthalate ( mehhp ), and mono -( 2 - ethyl - 5 - oxohexyl ) phthalate ( meohp ) were seen in some 300 - 700 of the subjects , whereas monoisononyl phthalate ( minp ) and mono - n - octyl phthalate ( mop ) were found in only a few and monocyclohexyl phthalate ( mchp ) was not detected in any subject . neither the circulation levels of bpa nor those of phthalate metabolites differ between the genders in this elderly population of residents in uppsala , sweden .	0
cytotoxicity evaluation of dentin bonding agents by dentin barrier test on 3 - dimensional pulp cells .. objective : the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 4 dentin - bonding agents on the cell viability of bovine derived cells . study design : cytotoxicity of dentin - bonding agents ( g - bond [ gb ], adper prompt self - etch [ apse ], clearfil dc bond system [ cdcb ], and quadrant university - 1 - bond [ ub ]) was analyzed with a dentin barrier test device using 3 - dimensional ( 3d ) pulp cell cultures . a commercially available cell culture perfusion chamber was separated into 2 compartments using a 500 μm dentin disk . the 3d cultures were placed on a dentin disk and held in place with a special biocompatible stainless steel holder . test materials were introduced into the upper compartment in direct contact with the cavity side of the dentin disks according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . subsequently , the pulpal part of the perfusion chamber containing the cell cultures was perfused with a medium ( 2 ml / h ). after an exposure period of 24 hours , cell survival was determined by using the mtt assay . statistical analyses were performed using the mann - whitney u test . results : in the dentin barrier test , cell survival rates of ub and cdcb were similar to the control group ( p > . 05 ). however , all other tested materials were cytotoxic for the 3d pulp - derived cell cultures ( p < . 05 ). conclusions : dentin - bonding agents include biologically active ingredients and may modify pulp cell metabolism when the materials are used in deep cavities in spite of a dentin barrier . if these adhesive agents are used in deep cavities , a biocompatible cavity liner should be used .	0
microtensile bond strength analysis of different adhesive systems and dentin prepared with high - speed and er : yag laser : a comparative study .. objective : the aim of this study was to evaluate the bond strength of two adhesive systems ( single bond and clearfil se bond ) subjected or not to a thermocycling procedure and applied to cavities prepared either with high - speed diamond bur or er : yag laser . background data : one of the possible applications of dental lasers includes increasing the quality of bond strength . methods : this in vitro study was carried out using a microtensile test on 16 bovine teeth , divided into eight groups . cavities were prepared on superficial dentin of the medium portion of the buccal surface . after application of adhesive systems , composite restorations were performed at 5 - mm height . after 24 h , four groups of teeth were immersed in water , and the other four were thermocycled . bonded specimens were sectioned into serial 1x1 - mm beams , which were subjected to a microtensile test . final values of bond strength were measured , expressed in mpa , and statistically analyzed . results : results were as follows : g1 ( 26 . 281 +/- 5 . 454 mpa ); g2 ( 10 . 965 +/- 3 . 714 mpa ); g3 ( 18 . 549 +/- 6 . 113 mpa ); g4 ( 14 . 295 +/- 3 . 806 mpa ); g5 ( 18 . 225 +/- 5 . 701 mpa ); g6 ( 5 . 588 +/- 2 . 211 mpa ); g7 ( 18 . 256 +/- 3 . 819 mpa ); and g8 ( 15 . 423 +/- 4 . 714 mpa ). conclusions : self - etching adhesive system ( se ) produced more stable bond strength results than the system that indicates total etching ( sb ). for dentin prepared at high speed , the total etching adhesive system was more indicated , whereas er : yag laser - preparation dentin was not influenced by the adhesive system . the thermocycling procedure could negatively affect microtensile bond strength of both adhesive systems , being more deleterious to sb than to se .	0
fast liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of bisphenol a - diglycidyl ether , bisphenol f - diglycidyl ether and their derivatives in canned food and beverages .. in this work a fast liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) method using a c18 fused core ™ column , was developed for the simultaneous analysis of bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ), bisphenol a ( 2 , 3 - dihydroxypropyl ) glycidyl ether ( badge · h ( 2 ) o ), bisphenol a bis ( 2 , 3 - dihydroxypropyl ) ether ( badge · 2h ( 2 ) o ), bisphenol a ( 3 - chloro - 2 - hydroxypropyl ) glycidyl ether ( badge · hcl ), bisphenol a bis ( 3 - chloro - 2 - hydroxypropyl ) ether ( badge · 2hcl ) and bisphenol a ( 3 - chloro - 2 - hydroxypropyl )( 2 , 3 - dihydroxypropyl ether ) ( badge · hcl · h ( 2 ) o ) and bisphenol f diglycidyl ether ( bfdge ), bisphenol f bis ( 2 , 3 - dihydroxypropyl ) ether ( bfdge · 2h ( 2 ) o ), bisphenol f bis ( 3 - chloro - 2 - hydroxypropyl ) ether ( bfdge · 2hcl ). the lc method was coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer , using an esi source in positive mode and using the [ m + nh ( 4 )](+) adduct as precursor ion for tandem mass spectrometry experiments . the method developed was applied to the determination of these compounds in canned soft drinks and canned food . oasis hlb solid phase extraction ( spe ) cartridges were used for the analysis of soft drinks , while solid canned food was extracted with ethyl acetate . method limits of quantitation ranged from 0 . 13 μgl (- 1 ) to 1 . 6 μgl (- 1 ) in soft drinks and 1 . 0 μgkg (- 1 ) to 4 . 0 μgkg (- 1 ) in food samples . badge · 2h ( 2 ) o was detected in all the analyzed samples , while other badges such as badge · h ( 2 ) o , badge · hcl · h ( 2 ) o , badge · hcl and badge · 2hcl were also detected in canned foods .	0
most plastic products release estrogenic chemicals : a potential health problem that can be solved .. background : chemicals having estrogenic activity ( ea ) reportedly cause many adverse health effects , especially at low ( picomolar to nanomolar ) doses in fetal and juvenile mammals . objectives : we sought to determine whether commercially available plastic resins and products , including baby bottles and other products advertised as bisphenol a ( bpa ) free , release chemicals having ea . methods : we used a roboticized mcf - 7 cell proliferation assay , which is very sensitive , accurate , and repeatable , to quantify the ea of chemicals leached into saline or ethanol extracts of many types of commercially available plastic materials , some exposed to common - use stresses ( microwaving , ultraviolet radiation , and / or autoclaving ). results : almost all commercially available plastic products we sampled -- independent of the type of resin , product , or retail source -- leached chemicals having reliably detectable ea , including those advertised as bpa free . in some cases , bpa - free products released chemicals having more ea than did bpa - containing products . conclusions : many plastic products are mischaracterized as being ea free if extracted with only one solvent and not exposed to common - use stresses . however , we can identify existing compounds , or have developed , monomers , additives , or processing agents that have no detectable ea and have similar costs . hence , our data suggest that ea - free plastic products exposed to common - use stresses and extracted by saline and ethanol solvents could be cost - effectively made on a commercial scale and thereby eliminate a potential health risk posed by most currently available plastic products that leach chemicals having ea into food products .	0
concentric - ringed structures in polymer thin films .. novel polymer crystalline structures containing micrometer - sized concentric rings ( or bands ) were observed in thin poly ( bisphenol a hexane ether ) ( ba - c6 ) films . the origin of the banded structures was found to be different from that of traditional banded spherulites in polymer systems . analyses based on optical microscopy ( om ) and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) revealed that the banded structures contained alternating ridge and valley bands of polymer crystals in the flat - on orientation . no lamellar twisting was observed within the concentric - ringed structures , which were developed as a result of the formation of a depletion zone during crystallization . the formation of a depletion zone was determined to be caused by the specific volume decrement between the crystal and the melt and by the diffusion of polymer chains to the fold surfaces of the flat - on lamellae . the height of the ridges and the interband widths could be adjusted by controlling the diffusion rate . time - of - flight secondary ion mass spectrometry ion images showed higher concentrations of low - molecular - weight polymer chains on the surfaces of the ridges than in the valleys .	0
the effect of different surface treatments on the shear bond strength of luting cements to titanium .. statement of problem : although titanium presents attractive physical and mechanical properties , there is a need for improving the bond at the titanium / luting cement interface for the longevity of metal ceramic restorations . purpose : the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of surface treatments on the shear bond strength ( sbs ) of resin - modified glass ionomer and resin cements to commercially pure titanium ( cp ti ). material and methods : two hundred and forty cp ti cast disks ( 9 . 0 × 3 . 0 mm ) were divided into 8 surface treatment groups ( n = 30 ): 1 ) 50 µm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles ; 2 ) 120 µm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles ; 3 ) 250 µm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles ; 4 ) 50 µm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles + silane ( relyx ceramic primer ); 5 ) 120 µm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles + silane ; 6 ) 250 µm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles + silane ; 7 ) 30 µm silica - modified al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles ( cojet sand ) + silane ; and 8 ) 120 µm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles , followed by 110 µm silica - modified al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles ( rocatec ). the luting cements 1 ) relyx luting 2 ; 2 ) relyx arc ; or 3 ) relyx u100 were applied to the treated cp ti surfaces ( n = 10 ). shear bond strength ( sbs ) was tested after thermal cycling ( 5000 cycles , 5 ° c to 55 ° c ). data were analyzed by 2 - way analysis of variance ( anova ) and the tukey hsd post hoc test ( α =. 05 ). failure mode was determined with a stereomicroscope (× 20 ). results : the surface treatments , cements , and their interaction significantly affected the sbs ( p <. 001 ). relyx luting 2 and relyx u100 exhibited similar behavior for all surface treatments . for both cements , only the group abraded with 50 μm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles had lower sbs than the other groups ( p <. 05 ). for relyx arc , regardless of silane application , abrasion with 50 μm al ( 2 ) o ( 3 ) particles resulted in significantly lower sbs than abrasion with 120 μm and 250 μm particles , which exhibited statistically similar sbs values to each other . rocatec + silane promoted the highest sbs for relyx arc . relyx u100 presented the highest sbs mean values ( p <. 001 ). all groups showed a predominance of adhesive failure mode . conclusions : the adhesive capability of relyx luting 2 and relyx u100 on the sbs was decisive , while for relyx arc , mechanical and chemical factors were more influential .	0
influence of the coexisting contaminants on bisphenol a sorption and desorption in soil .. the effects of different heavy metals ( cd , pb ), surfactants ( cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ( ctab ), cetylpyridine chloride ( cpc )) and the ionic strength ( ca2 +, nh4 +) on breakthrough curves ( btcs ) for sorption and desorption of bisphenol a ( bpa ) were studied using soil column experiment . results showed that the presence of heavy metals and cationic surfactants caused a significant increase on the bpa sorption . in addition , the volume required when effluent concentration reached half of the influent concentration ( vc1 / 2 ) increased due to the introduction of heavy metals and surfactants . it was also found that the larger amount of bpa was absorbed with higher ionic strength . the cationic surfactants enhanced the desorption ability of bpa from the soil . the results provided a better understanding of bpa behavior in environment and facilitated more accurate assessment of its ecological risk and identification of appropriate management strategies .	0
the retentive effects of pre - fabricated posts by luting cements .. the purpose of this study was to compare the retention of two different pre - fabricated posts cemented to the root canal with four different adhesive luting cements and a zinc phosphate cement . the crowns of 100 freshly extracted human mandibular central and lateral incisors were removed at the cementoenamel junction and divided into two main groups ( a = parapost and b = flexi - post ) and further divided into five subgroups to evaluate the effects of five different cements ( rely - x arc , panavia f , parapost cement , flexi - flow natural and adhesor ) each with 10 samples . post - holes were prepared on all of the roots following the manufacturer ' s instructions . each sample was placed into a specialized jig and tensile strength tests performed by using testing machine with a crosshead speed of 0 . 638 cm min (- 1 ) and force applied until failure . the data were analysed with one - way anova ( post hoc a scheffe ' s s test ) and two - way anova ( p < 0 . 001 ). the flexi - post dowels had a mean of 54 . 21 kg ( s . d . = 9 . 37 ) and demonstrated statistically higher retention than parapost dowels with a mean of 33 . 93 kg ( s . d . = 10 . 69 ) for all of the cement groups ( p < 0 . 001 ). in flexi - post and parapost dowel groups ; rely - x arc was statistically higher than the panavia f , parapost cement , flexi - flow natural and adhesor ( p < 0 . 05 ). adhesor was significantly lower than the other subgroups ( p < 0 . 05 ). resin luting cements have demonstrated very high tensile strength potential for a strong bond to dentin .	0
acute testis toxicity of bisphenol a diglycidyl ether in sprague - dawley rats .. objectives : bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) is a liquid compound obtained by condensation of two molecules of epichlorohydrin with one molecule of bisphenol a . general and reproductive toxicity with badge has been reported higher than 1000 mg / kg / day . this study was performed to show the effects of acute exposure to badge below 1000 mg / kg / day on the testis in adult male rats . methods : badge was administered by gastric lavage in a single dose of 500 , 750 , 1000 , and 2000 mg / kg / day in 8 - week old male spf sprague - dawley rats . the right testis was processed for light microscopic analysis . the left testis was homogenized and spermatids were counted to determine the daily sperm production and daily abnormal sperm production . the sperm count , sperm motility , and incidence of abnormal sperm were estimated in the epididymis . in testicular sections , the seminiferous tubules were observed for qualitative changes . the progression of spermatogenesis was arbitrarily classified as full - matured , maturing , and immature . the specimen slide was observed at 3 points and 10 seminiferous tubules were evaluated at each point . results : the male rats exposed to single oral dose of badge at 750 , 1000 , and 2000 mg / kg / day were significantly increased the number of immature and maturing sperm on the testis . there were no significant differences with respect to sperm head count , sperm motility , and sperm abnormality in the badge treatment groups . conclusions : these results suggest that single oral exposure of badge 750 mg / kg / day can affect adult male testis development .	0
cariostatic effect of glass ionomer retained orthodontic appliances . an in vivo study .. the cariostatic effect of a fluoride releasing bonding agent was investigated and compared with a conventional composite based material in connection with bonding of orthodontic brackets in 22 homologous pairs of premolars . all subjects had malocclusions requiring orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances and extraction of at least two premolars . 6 - 13 weeks prior to extraction , orthodontic brackets were bonded to the labial surfaces of the extraction teeth with either a glass ionomer cement or a bis - gma resin . initially , the children were instructed in tooth brushing and the regular use of fluoride . after extraction , the bonded teeth were stained and evaluated in a stereo - microscope regarding the incidence and extension of initial enamel demineralisation . the zone of intact enamel adjacent to the bracket base and bonding material was measured in a stereo - microscope at four predetermined locations with the aid of an electronic ruler and scored according to four categories . the incidence of enamel demineralisation adjacent to glass ionomer bonded and composite bonded brackets was 68 % and 77 % respectively . in 12 pairs of premolars however , the demineralisation appeared to a lesser extent on the enamel around the brackets was generally wider when glass ionomer cement was used compared to the composite resin . these differences were statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) mesially and distally , but non - significant cervically and incisally . the results indicate that bonding with glass ionomer cement may have a local cariostatic effect in children requiring fixed orthodontic appliances .	0
bisphenol a glucuronidation and absorption in rat intestine .. bisphenol a , an environmental estrogen , can be leached from plastic tableware and from the coating of food and drink cans , orally exposing human beings to the compound . the present study focuses on the absorption and metabolism of bisphenol a in the rat intestine , as elucidated experimentally by segmented everted intestine . one hour after the application of 2 micromol of bisphenol a to the mucosal fluid , the absorption of bisphenol a was slightly greater in the colon ( 48 . 6 %) than in the proximal jejunum ( 37 . 5 %). in the serosal side , unconjugated bisphenol a appeared in small amounts , increasing distally ( maximal 1 . 6 nmol , colon ). large amounts of the bisphenol a glucuronide were then transported into the serosal side , also increasing distally ( proximal , 80 . 4 nmol ; distal , 478 . 4 nmol ). the greatest amount of the glucuronide ( approximately 573 nmol ) was excreted into the mucosal side of the small intestine , whereas in the colon , mucosal excretion was minimal ( 67 . 2 nmol ). on high - dose application of bisphenol a to the mucosal fluid , the transported unconjugated bisphenol a increased markedly throughout the intestine and colon . these results suggest that bisphenol a in the intestinal lumen is glucuronidated almost exclusively during its passage through the intestinal wall .	0
levels of bisphenol a in canned soft drink products in canadian markets .. the method developed previously for the determination of bisphenol a ( bpa ) in liquid infant formula was adapted and validated for determination of bpa in soft drink products . this method was based on solid phase extraction and derivatization with acetic anhydride followed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry in selected - ion monitoring mode . the average method detection limit was 0 . 045 microg / l for a 10 ml sample . the average extraction recoveries were 101 and 99 . 9 % obtained with seven different soft drink products spiked with bpa at 0 . 5 and 2 . 5 microg / l , respectively . good repeatability of the method was observed with replicate analyses of seven different soft drinks ; relative standard deviations ranged from 1 . 3 to 6 . 6 %. this method was used to analyze samples of 72 canned soft drink products for bpa . except for three products from which bpa - d16 could not be recovered at all due to interference of product compositions ( e . g ., quinine hydrochloride in tonic water ), bpa was detected in samples of all the other products at levels ranging from 0 . 032 to 4 . 5 microg / l . about 75 % of the products had bpa levels of < 0 . 5 microg / l , and 85 % of the products had bpa levels of < 1 microg / l . exposure to bpa through consumption of canned soft drink products is low ; dietary intake of bpa was estimated at 0 . 027 microg / kg of body weight / day on the basis of the consumption of one canned soft drink with the highest bpa level ( 4 . 5 microg / l ) for an adult with a 60 kg body weight , well below the provisional tolerable daily intake of 25 microg / kg of body weight / day established by health canada .	0
strength and setting behavior of resin - modified glass ionomer cements .. diametral tensile strength ( dts ), fracture strength , and vickers microhardness were tested in three resin - modified glass ionomer cements ( gics ), one chemically set gic , and one dental composite . for the dts studies test discs were immersed in deionized water at 37 degrees c for 10 min , 1 day , and 28 days , respectively . cured discs were also implanted in back muscles of rats for 28 days before testing . the effects of light irradiation time and delayed curing on the dts of the cements were also studied . significantly higher strength was observed in the resin - modified gics in comparison with the chemically set gic at all observation period . k71 showed the highest strength among the gics . no strength reductions were detected after 28 days for the specimens in vivo . an illumination time of 20 sec was enough to obtain final strength in the pfa and k71 specimens , and 40 sec was needed in the vi specimens . the strength of the resin - modified gics when light - cured was significantly higher than when the same cements were allowed to set without irradiation . the microhardness of the light - cured gics was similar to that of the dental composite . considering the improved fracture strength and surface hardness , it was concluded that the resin - modified gics present an interesting material for further development .	0
impact of environmental chemicals on the thyroid hormone function in pituitary rat gh3 cells .. endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) are widespread in the environment and suspected to interfere with the function of thyroid hormones ( ths ). we investigated the th disrupting activity of different classes of edcs including plasticizers ( bisphenol a , bisphenol a dimethacrylate ), alkylphenols ( 4 - n - nonylphenol , 4 - octylphenol ), pesticides ( prochloraz , iprodion , chlorpyrifos ), pcb metabolites ( oh - pcb 106 , oh - pcb 121 , oh - pcb 69 ) and brominated flame - retardants ( tetrabromobisphenol a ). the ed potential of a chemical was determined by its effect on the cell proliferation of th - dependent rat pituitary gh3 cell line . all tested chemicals significantly interfered with the cell proliferation alone or upon co - treatment with t3 . the growth of gh3 cells was stimulated by all tested chemicals , but 4 - n - nonylphenol , 4 - octylphenol , prochloraz and iprodion elicited an inhibitory effect on cell growth . in conclusion , these edcs have the potential to exert th disruption increasing the risk or a negative impact on fetal brain development , resulting in cognitive dysfunctions .	0
cytotoxic effects and aromatase inhibition by xenobiotic endocrine disrupters alone and in combination .. xenobiotics may cause long - term adverse effects in humans , especially at the embryonic level , raising questions about their levels of exposure , combined effects , and crucial endpoints . we are interested in the possible interactions between xenobiotic endocrine disrupters , cellular viability and androgen metabolism . accordingly , we tested aroclor 1254 ( a1254 ), atrazine ( az ), o , p '- ddt , vinclozolin ( vz ), p , p '- dde , bisphenol a ( bpa ), chlordecone ( cd ), nonylphenol ( np ), tributylin oxide ( tbto ), and diethylstilbestrol ( des ) for cellular toxicity against human embryonic 293 cells , and activity against cellular aromatase , but also on placental microsomes and on the purified equine enzyme . cellular viability was affected in 24 h by all the xenobiotics with a threshold at 50 microm ( except for tbto and des , 10 microm threshold ), and aromatase was inhibited at non - toxic doses . in combination synergism was observed reducing the threshold values of toxicity to 4 - 10 microm , and aromatase activity by 50 % in some cases . in placental microsomes the most active xenobiotics rapidly inhibited microsomal aromatase in a manner independent of nadph metabolism . prolonged exposures to low doses in cells generally amplified by 50 times aromatase inhibition . these xenobiotics may act by inhibition of the active site or by allosteric effects on the enzyme . bioaccumulation is a feature of some xenobiotics , especially chlordecone , ddt and dde , and low level chronic exposures can also affect cell signaling mechanisms . this new information about the mechanism of action of these xenobiotics will assist in improved molecular design with a view to providing safer compounds for use in the ( human ) environment .	0
in vitro embryotoxicity assessment with dental restorative materials .. objectives : resin ( co ) monomers may be released from restorative dental materials and can diffuse into the tooth pulp or the gingiva , and can reach the saliva and the circulating blood . genotoxic potential of some dental composite components has been clearly documented . the genotoxic effects of xenobiotics can represent a possible step in tumor initiation and / or embryotoxicity / teratogenesis . a modified fluorescent mouse embryonic stem cell test ( r . e . tox ) was used to test the embryotoxic potential of following dental restorative materials : bisphenol a glycidylmethacrylate ( bisgma ), urethanedimethacrylate ( udma ), hydroxyethylmethacrylate ( hema ), and triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate ( tegdma ), as well as some of their metabolic intermediates 2 , 3 - epoxy - 2 - methyl - propionicacid - methylester ( empme ), methacrylic acid ( ma ), and 2 , 3 - epoxy - 2 - methylpropionic acid ( empa ). methods : mouse embryonic stem ( es ) cells stably transfected with a vector containing the gene for the green fluorescent protein under control of the cardiac alpha - myosin heavy chain promoter were differentiated in the presence of various concentrations of the test compounds for 12 days . fluorescence was measured using the tecan safire and values were expressed as percent of control values . to distinguish between cytotoxic and embryotoxic effects , all compounds were tested in a standard mtt assay . results : hema , tegdma and empme did not influence the differentiation process of es cells towards cardiac myocytes . no cytotoxic effects were observed at any of the concentration levels tested . exposure to bisgma resulted in a 50 % decrease in cell survival and a very strong inhibition of cell differentiation at 10 (- 5 ) m ( p < 0 . 01 ). embryotoxic effects were also present at 10 (- 6 ) and 10 (- 7 ) m ( p < 0 . 05 ). empa induced a decrease in es cell differentiation at 10 (- 5 ) m ( p < 0 . 01 ) without cytotoxic effects . no embryotoxic effects were induced at lower concentrations . exposure to udma resulted in a slight decrease of cell differentiation at 10 (- 5 ) m ( p < 0 . 05 ). exposure of cells to ma resulted in an increase of cardiac differentiation up to 150 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) at 10 (- 5 ) m without cytotoxic effects . conclusions : bisgma induced a significant high embryotoxic / teratogenic effect over a large range of concentration . therefore attention should be focused on this dental monomer , which should be investigated further by in vivo experiments .	0
immune response to ovalbumin following bisphenol a administration in mice fed with a low level of dietary protein .. background and purpose : we have previously shown that bisphenol a ( bpa ) augments t - helper ( th ) 1 activity with no significant effects on an established oral tolerance to ovalbumin ( ova ) in mice fed with a normal protein diet . the present study aimed to examine the effect of bpa on the immune response in a mouse model maintained on a very low protein diet ( 5 % casein ). methods : mice were fed on a 5 % protein diet , together with either ova ( ova - fed ) or water ( water - fed ), immunized intraperitoneally with ova at 3 - week intervals and administered bpa between the 2 immunizations . a week after the last immunization , animals were sacrificed and examined by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay for serum titers of total immunoglobulin e ( ige ), ova - specific ige , immunoglobulin g ( igg ), igg1 , igg2a , and the production of interferon - gamma , interleukin ( il )- 4 , and il - 12 . results : in both bpa - treated and non - treated animals , ova feeding resulted in lower titers of total and ova - specific ige , and ova - specific igg ( p < 0 . 05 ). there were higher levels of interferon - gamma ( p < 0 . 05 ), il - 4 , and il - 12 ( p < 0 . 05 ) in animals with ova tolerance following bpa treatment . however , il - 12 production was augmented only in bpa - treated water - fed animals ( p < 0 . 01 ). conclusion : bpa administration in mice fed with a low level of dietary protein augmented th1 cytokines more profoundly in the animals with ova tolerance than in the non - tolerant animals .	0
wear behavior of a composite restorative and various styli in sliding contact .. using a pin - on - disc sliding - wear test apparatus , the wear behavior of a typical composite restorative vs . styli fashioned from human enamel , sintered alumina , and magnesium fluoride was examined . the rates of restorative wear were found to be identical , within the experimental error of the measurements , for tests using either human enamel pins or styli fabricated from sintered alumina . moreover , these two pin materials generated morphologically similar wear - tracks in the restorative disc . thus , styli of sintered alumina produce restorative wear that is both qualitatively and quantitatively analogous to that observed in tests using human enamel pins .	0
clinical evaluation of polyacid - modified resin composite posterior restorations : one - year results .. objective : the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical performance of a new compomer restorative system , dyract ap , placed in combination with non - rinse conditioner and prime & bond nt in permanent posterior teeth . method and materials : fifty class ii and 41 class i restorations were placed in 39 patients by 1 dentist . the restorations were evaluated directly , with modified us public health service criteria , and indirectly , with color slides and polyvinyl siloxane impressions , at baseline and 6 months and 1 year after placement . preoperative and 1 - year postoperative bitewing radiographs were also taken . results : all 82 restorations available for 1 - year evaluation were in situ . no postoperative sensitivity or pulpal problems were reported . four class ii restorations ( 4 . 9 %) failed because of partial fracture or recurrent caries . the percentages of alfa score for each criterion were color match , 95 . 1 %; marginal discoloration , 57 . 3 %; marginal integrity , 35 . 4 %; anatomic form , 98 . 8 %; and surface texture , 91 . 5 %. the average wear rate of dyract ap was low ( 18 . 5 +/- 11 . 7 microns at 6 months and 35 . 7 +/- 13 . 6 microns at 12 months ). conclusion : the excellent handling characteristics , the good clinical performance , and the improved wear resistance suggest that this compomer will provide reliable direct tooth - colored restorations in stress - bearing areas .	0
bisphenol a differentially activates protein kinase c isoforms in murine placental tissue .. bisphenol a is utilized to make polycarbonate plastics and is an environmental pollutant . recent research has indicated that it is an endocrine disruptor and may interfere with reproductive processes . our lab has previously shown that bisphenol a could regulate corticotrophin releasing hormone and aromatase in cultured placental cells . in the present study , the effect of bisphenol a on these two genes in the placenta was investigated in mice . pregnant icr mice were gavaged with bisphenol a at 2 , 20 and 200mg / kg body weight / day from e13 to e16 and were euthanized at e17 . compared to the control mice , increased plasma estrogen and corticotrophin releasing hormone were observed in bisphenol a - treated mice . messenger rna quantification indicated that placental crh but not cyp19 was induced in mice treated with bisphenol a . tracking the related signaling pathway , we found that protein kinase c ζ / λ and δ were activated in the placentas of bisphenol a - treated mice . as the gene promoter of crh contains cre and the half site of ere , either phospho - pkc or estrogen could stimulate the gene transactivation . these results indicate that bisphenol a might increase plasma concentrations of estradiol , testosterone , corticotrophin releasing hormone and placental phospho - pkc ζ / λ and δ in mice . ultimately , the incidence of premature birth in these mice could increase .	0
human udp - glucuronosyltransferase isoforms involved in bisphenol a glucuronidation .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is one of a number of potential endocrine disruptors which may affect normal hormonal function . in this study , human udp - glucuronosyltransferase ( ugt ) isoforms involved in bpa glucuronidation were studied by kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes and recombinant human ugts expressed in insect cells ( ugt1a1 , ugt1a3 , ugt1a4 , ugt1a6 , ugt1a9 , ugt2b4 , ugt2b7 , ugt2b15 and ugt2b17 ). bpa glucuronidation was catalyzed by ugt1a1 , ugt1a3 , ugt1a9 , ugt2b4 , ugt2b7 and ugt2b15 as well as by human liver microsomes . among these ugts , ugt2b15 showed the highest activity of bpa glucuronidation at low - ( 1 . 0 microm ) and high - ( 20 microm ) substrate concentrations . kinetic analyses of bpa glucuronidation were performed by constructing michaelis - menten and eadie - hofstee plots . the kinetic profile of bpa glucuronidation by pooled human liver microsomes and ugt2b15 was monophasic , the k ( m ) and v ( max ) values were 6 . 39 microm and 4250 pmol min (- 1 ) mg (- 1 ) protein for pooled human liver microsomes , and 8 . 68 microm and 873 pmol min (- 1 ) mg (- 1 ) protein for ugt2b15 , respectively . the k ( m ) values for bpa glucuronidation by pooled human liver microsomes and ugt2b15 were similar . these findings demonstrate that bpa is mainly glucuronidated by ugt2b15 in human liver microsomes , and suggest that this ugt isoform plays important roles in the detoxification and elimination of bpa .	0
shear modulus of 5 flowable composites to the everstick ortho fiber - reinforced composite retainer : an in - vitro study .. introduction : although fiber - reinforced composites ( frc ) are now available for use as orthodontic retainers , little is known about their bonding properties . our aim in this study was to investigate the adhesive properties of various composites to a commercially available frc retainer . methods : five flowable composites ( grandio flow [ voco gmbh , cuxhaven , germany ], synergy flow [ coltène / whaledent ag , genf , switzerland ], tetric flow [ ivoclar vivadent ag , schaan fürstentum , liechtenstein ], tetric flow chroma [ ivoclar vivadent ag ], and transbond lr [ 3m unitek , monrovia , calif ) were tested for their shear bond strengths to the everstick ortho ( stick tech ltd oy , turku , finland ) frc retainer stick . each group contained 15 samples and underwent 1000 aging cycles between 5 degrees c and 55 degrees c . a testing machine was used to measure the shear bond strengths at the composite - frc interface . all specimens were visually controlled for the location of the fracture line . results : typical shear bond strengths were measured at 40 n or 8 mpa . no significant difference was found between the 5 composites ( anova , p < or = 0 . 05 ). the fracture line was consistently in the frc retainer . conclusions : all composites had similar bonding characteristics , and visual inspection consistently showed fractures in the frc retainer . because the point of least resistance was in the retainer , we concluded that all tested composites were equally effective .	0
temperature rise in pulpal chamber during fabrication of provisional resinous crowns .. statement of problem : the heat generated during the exothermic polymerization reaction of autopolymerizing resinous materials and the heat generated by ultraviolet lamps during irradiation of photopolymerizing resinous materials could cause pulpal damage when a direct technique is used to fabricate provisional restorations . this could occur if temperature elevations overcome the physiological heat dissipating mechanisms of the dental - periodontal system . purpose : this in vitro study compared the rise in temperatures in the pulpal chamber during fabrication of provisional complete veneer crowns by direct method with different autopolymerizing and photopolymerizing resins . the effect of curing resinous crowns in different matrices , such as a polyvinyl siloxane impression and a vaccuum - formed polypropylene sheet , was also evaluated . results : the results demonstrated that the amount of heat generated during resin polymerization and transmitted to the pulpal chamber could be damaging to pulpal tissues including odontoblasts . when curing of provisional resinous crowns was performed in the polyvinyl siloxane impression , significantly lower temperatures were recorded compared with curing in the vacuum - formed polypropylene sheet . conclusions : to prevent pulpal damage , effective cooling procedures are strongly recommended when directly fabricating resinous provisional crowns .	0
the efficacy of dental sealants for an adult population .. a 1 - year pilot study was conducted to determine the retentive capacities of dental sealants on adult teeth . it proposed to utilize the knowledge and experience gained in sealant application , as a means of attacking the problem of the increase in restored teeth at risk in the aging population . eighty patients aged 30 - 50 had delton tinted sealant applied on one to four contralateral nonhomologous , first or second , acceptable molar pairs . fifty - five patients completed the evaluation at 1 year , with a 68 % retention for 250 teeth : teeth listed as sound , 94 . 1 %; ic and ic - amalgam , 93 . 7 %, and amalgam , 44 . 9 %.	0
formation of adducts by bisphenol a , an endocrine disruptor , in dna in vitro and in liver and mammary tissue of mice .. endocrine disruptors ( eds ) represent a major toxicological and public health issue , and the xenoestrogen bisphenol a ( bpa ) has received much attention due to its high production volume and widespread human exposure . also , due to its similarity to diethylstilbestrol , a known human carcinogen , bpa has been investigated for its genotoxic and carcinogenic properties , but the results have been either inconclusive or controversial . metabolically activated bpa has previously been shown to form dna adducts both in vitro and in rat liver . the present study was designed ( a ) to assess the sensitivity threshold of dna - adduct detection by 32p - postlabelling in an acellular system and ( b ) to evaluate the formation of dna adducts in both liver and mammary cells of female cd - 1 mice receiving bpa in their drinking water ( 200 mg / kg body weight ) for eight consecutive days . the reaction of bpa with calf thymus dna , in the presence of s9 mix , resulted in a dose - dependent formation of multiple dna adducts , with a detection limit of approximately 10 ng of this ed under our experimental conditions . administration of bpa to mice confirmed that dna adducts are formed in liver ( 3 . 4 - fold higher levels than in controls ). in addition , new evidence is provided that dna adducts are formed in target mammary cells ( 4 . 7 - fold higher than in controls ). although dna adducts do not necessarily evolve into tumours or other chronic degenerative diseases , the formation of these molecular lesions in target mammary cells may bear relevance for the potential involvement of bpa in breast carcinogenesis .	0
development of an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay for bisphenol a using chicken immunoglobulins .. bisphenol a was coupled , after derivatization into a suitable hapten , to bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin in order to produce immunizing and coating antigens . the immunizing antigens were injected into chickens , which allowed the isolation of specific bisphenol a immunoglobulins from the egg yolk . these antibodies were used in an indirect competitive enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay for the determination of bisphenol a in aqueous solutions . various parameters , influencing the assay sensitivity , were evaluated . the applicability of the assay for the determination of bisphenol a in milk was also studied . the assay was not as sensitive as other analytical techniques used in bisphenol a analysis , since typical i ( 50 ) levels of 2 . 5 microm were reached in aqueous solutions . this study nevertheless illustrates the usefulness and the potency of chicken antibodies in the analysis of migration residues from packaging materials using immunochemical techniques . in addition , the assay showed to be quite specific for bisphenol a as well . only for bisphenol a analogues , cross reactivities of about 40 % were reached , enabling the use of the antibodies for the screening of bisphenol a and alike compounds .	0

processing of bisphenol a by plant tissues : glucosylation by cultured by - 2 cells and glucosylation / translocation by plants of nicotiana tabacum .. bisphenol a ( bpa , 4 , 4 '- isopropylidenediphenol ), an endocrine disrupter with estrogenic properties , was supplied to tobacco by - 2 cells in suspension culture and the chemical nature of its metabolites was investigated . the concentration of bpa in the culture medium decreased rapidly and became undetectable at 2 . 5 h after the application . four metabolites of bpa were observed in a methanol extract of the cells when the culture was supplemented with [( 14 ) c ] bpa . the most abundant metabolite was determined to be 4 , 4 '- isopropylidenediphenol - o - beta - d - glucopyranoside ( bpag ) by mass spectrometry , nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by hydrolysis with beta - glucosidase . this identification was confirmed by synthesis . when [( 14 ) c ] bpa was administrated to tobacco seedlings from their roots , radioactivity was incorporated in bpag and three unidentified metabolites . these metabolites were accumulated in the leaves after 4 h exposure , indicating that tobacco seedlings absorbed bpa through their root systems , metabolized to its beta - glucoside and translocated the metabolites to their leaves .	0
sorption of endocrine disrupting chemicals by condensed organic matter in soils and sediments .. sorption of 17alpha - ethinyl estradiol ( ee2 ) and bisphenol a ( bpa ) by nonhydrolyzable carbon ( nhc ), black carbon ( bc ), and bulk soils and sediments was examined . all sorption isotherms were nonlinear and fitted both freundlich and dubinin - ashtakhov ( da ) models . the single - point organic carbon ( oc )- normalized distribution coefficient ( k ( oc )) of ee2 for the isolated nhc and bc was 2 . 7 - 4 . 8 times and 5 . 4 - 12 . 9 times greater , respectively , than that of the bulk samples . however , no clear trend in bpa k ( oc ) values was observed . based on the contribution of soil / sediment organic matter ( som ) fractions to the overall sorption of bpa or ee2 by the bulk samples , condensed som ( nhc and bc ) generally played a dominant role to the overall sorption . the bpa adsorption capacity ( q ( oc )( 0 )) from the da model was higher than that of ee2 on nhc and there was obvious difference in isotherm nonlinearity ( n ) between ee2 and bpa . these results suggest that bpa may have more access to the pore sites of nhc samples than ee2 . the pi - pi bonds formed between bpa and nhc or bc may be stronger than that between ee2 and nhc or bc . this would be attributed to the fact that bpa has two benzene rings , and can also be used to explain the difference in hexadecane - water partition coefficient ( k ( hw ))- normalized k ( oc ) values ( k ( oc )/ k ( hw )) of bpa and ee2 after factoring out the hydrophobic effect . these findings could be useful for predicting fate and ecological risks of endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) ( e . g ., ee2 and bpa ) in natural environments especially when soils or sediments become receptors for edcs .	0
enhanced aesthetics using provisionalization .. the proper fabrication of provisional restorations is integral to the overall success of restorative dentistry , as these templates are the initial architecture for the completed case . in a clinical setting , restorations may be utilized for an extended period , during which time the clinician and patient must feel confident . due partially to a new generation of dental materials with unique properties , provisionalization can be predictably achieved . this article reviews the clinical criteria for the fabrication of interim restorations using a light cure / dual phase temporary crown and bridge material ( provipont dc , ivoclar vivadent , amherst , ny ) and its effect on the overall success of restorative procedures , including anterior and posterior restorations .	0
bisphenol a impairs mitochondrial function in the liver at doses below the no observed adverse effect level .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) has been reported to possess hepatic toxicity . we investigated the hypothesis that bpa , below the no observed adverse effect level ( noael ), can induce hepatic damage and mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing oxidative stress in the liver . two doses of bpa , 0 . 05 and 1 . 2 mg / kg body weight / day , were administered intraperitoneally for 5 days to mice . both treatments impaired the structure of the hepatic mitochondria , although oxygen consumption rate and expression of the respiratory complex decreased only at the higher dose . the hepatic levels of malondialdehyde ( mda ), a naturally occurring product of lipid peroxidation , increased , while the expression of glutathione peroxidase 3 ( gpx3 ) decreased , after bpa treatment . the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) and tumor necrosis factor - α ( tnf - α ) also increased . in hepg2 cells , 10 or 100 nm of bpa also decreased the oxygen consumption rate , atp production , and the mitochondrial membrane potential . in conclusion , doses of bpa below the noael induce mitochondrial dysfunction in the liver , and this is associated with an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation .	0
vegf - a expression in osteoclasts is regulated by nf - kappab induction of hif - 1alpha .. large osteoclasts ( 10 + nuclei ), predominant in rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease , have higher expression of proteases and activating receptors and also have increased resorptive activity when compared to small ( 2 - 5 nuclei ) osteoclasts . we hypothesized that large and small osteoclasts activate different signaling pathways . a signal transduction pathway finder array was used to compare gene expression of large and small osteoclasts in raw 264 . 7 - derived osteoclasts . expression of vascular endothelial growth factor a ( vegfa ) was higher in large osteoclasts and this result was confirmed by rt - pcr . rt - pcr further showed that rankl treatment of raw cells induced vegfa expression in a time - dependent manner . moreover , vegf - a secretion in conditioned media was also increased in cultures with a higher proportion of large osteoclasts . to investigate the mechanism of vegfa induction , specific inhibitors for the transcription factors nf - kappab , ap - 1 , nfatc1 , and hif - 1 were used . dimethyl bisphenol a , the hif - 1alpha inhibitor , decreased vegfa mrna expression , whereas blocking nf - kappab , ap - 1 , and nfatc1 had no effect . furthermore , the nf - kappab inhibitor gliotoxin inhibited hif1alpha mrna expression . in conclusion , vegf - a gene and protein expression are elevated in large osteoclasts compared to small osteoclasts and this increase is regulated by hif - 1 . in turn , hif1alpha mrna levels are induced by rankl - mediated activation of nf - kappab . these findings reveal further differences in signaling between large and small osteoclasts and thereby identify novel therapeutic targets for highly resorptive osteoclasts in inflammatory bone loss .	0
evidence to suggest glutamic acid involvement in bisphenol a effect at the hypothalamic level in prepubertal male rats .. objectives : the aim of present paper was to study the probable role of glutamic acid ( glu ) as a mediator of bisphenol a ( bpa ) effect at the hypothalamic level and its effects on the reproductive axis of prepubertal male rats . methods : mated wistar rats were treated with either 0 . 1 % ethanol ( control group , n = 10 ) or bpa ( bpa group , n = 10 ) in their drinking water until their offspring were weaned at the age of 21 days . the estimated average dose of exposure to dams was approximately 2 . 5 mg / kg body weight / day of bpa . at the prepubertal stage ( 35 days of age ), the male rats were sacrificed and gn - rh and glutamic acid ( glu ) release , an amino acid involved in gn - rh secretion , were measured in hypothalamic samples containing medio basal and anterior preoptic area ( mbh - apoa ), by ria and hplc respectively . lh , fsh serum levels were measured by ria and testosterone by eqlia . results : gn - rh and glu release decreased significantly in animals exposed to bpa ( p < 0 . 001 , p < 0 . 01 ). lh , fsh and testosterone serum levels were also decreased by treatment ( p < 0 . 0001 ). conclusion : present results provide evidence that bpa may act at the hypothalamic level to decrease glu release which in turn may modify gn - rh secretion altering the normal function of the axis .	0
human biomonitoring in israel : past , present , future .. the first human biomonitoring ( hbm ) studies in israel in the 1970s and 80s focused on measuring exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) and organochlorine insecticides in the general population and organophosphate pesticides in agricultural workers . in the late 1990 s , a regional human biomonitoring study found differences in blood lead levels in children from israel , jordan , and the palestinian authority . taken together with data on time trends in lead emissions in israel , the study indicated the benefits from phasing out of leaded gasoline . more recently , a pilot study in pregnant women in jerusalem , conducted in collaboration with the us - cdc , found widespread exposure to phthalates , organophosphate pesticides , and the carbamate bendiocarb . creatinine - adjusted total dimethyl ( dm ) metabolite concentrations were between 4 and 6 times higher than populations of pregnant women in the united states . the israel ministry of health is currently collaborating with the hebrew university of jerusalem and al quds university to study exposures to phthalates and organophosphates in pregnant women in israel and the palestinian authority . the israel ministry of health has also begun the first national biomonitoring study to measure exposures to bisphenol a , phthalates , organophosphates , polyaromatic hydrocarbons , the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein , and cotinine in the israeli adult population . this study is being carried out in collaboration with the university of erlangen - nuremberg in germany . until recently , hbm programs in israel were targeted at selected occupational groups ( workers potentially exposed to metals , volatile organic compounds ( vocs ), and cholinesterase inhibitors ) and naval divers potentially exposed to environmental contaminants . the future of hbm in israel lies in extending such programs to measuring exposures in representative samples of the general population , increasing international collaboration in this field , developing analytical capacity and expertise , and increasing use of human biomonitoring studies in forming and evaluating environmental health policy .	0
orientational effect of surface - confined cyclodextrin on the inclusion of bisphenols .. the molecular recognition of various kinds of bisphenols ( bps ) and a bisphenol a - polymer conjugate ( bpa - polymer ) by a self - assembled monolayer ( sam ) of thiolated beta - cyclodextrin ( cd ) on a gold electrode was examined using cyclic voltammetry ( cv ). based on the inhibitory effect of bps on the inclusion of hydroquinone ( hq ) as a probe by the surface - confined cd , the association constants ( k ( assoc )) of bps with the immobilized beta - cd were estimated . the k ( assoc ) values for bps with the sam of 3 - dithiobis ( undecanoylamido )- 3 - deoxy - beta - cyclodextrin ( dtua - beta - cd ) were smaller than those in the free beta - cd system reported previously . a similar tendency was obtained when 6 -( lipoylamido )- 6 - deoxy - beta - cyclodextrin ( lp - beta - cd ) was used in place of dtua - beta - cd . the k ( assoc ) values for all the bps except for bisphenol b with the sam of lp - beta - cd were always larger than those with the sam of dtua - beta - cd , due to a difference in the orientation of the beta - cd moiety in the sams . furthermore , adsorption and desorption processes of the bpa - polymer from the surface - confined beta - cd was followed using local surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy .	0
perinatal exposure to xenoestrogens impairs mammary gland differentiation and modifies milk composition in wistar rats .. the current study examined the consequences of perinatal ( gestation + lactation ) exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) or diethylstilbestrol ( des ) on f1 mammary gland ( mg ) differentiation . bpa ( 0 , 0 . 7 or 64 μg / kg bw / day ) or des ( 6 μg / kg bw / day ) was administered in the drinking water of f0 rats from gestational day 9 ( gd9 ) until weaning . f1 females were bred , mg samples obtained on gd18 and gd21 , and , during lactation , milk yield and milk protein composition were assessed . on gd18 , there was a decrease in α - lactalbumin and β - casein levels that was accompanied by reduced prolactin receptor and stat5a / b expression . on gd21 , delayed histological mg differentiation was observed . β - casein levels remained decreased on gd21 and in milk samples . moreover , the bpa - and des - exposed groups had an altered milk yield pattern during lactation . the long - lasting effects of perinatal exposure to low doses of xenoestrogens included delayed mg differentiation , altered milk yield and modified milk composition .	0
"""regulation of blood - testis barrier dynamics by desmosome , gap junction , hemidesmosome and polarity proteins : an unexpected turn of events .. the blood - testis barrier ( btb ) is a unique ultrastructure in the mammalian testis . unlike other blood - tissue barriers , such as the blood - brain barrier and the blood - ocular ( or blood - retina ) barrier which formed by tight junctions ( tj ) between endothelial cells of the microvessels , the btb is constituted by coexisting tj , basal ectoplasmic specialization ( basal es ), desmosomes and gap junctions between adjacent sertoli cells near the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubule . the btb also divides the seminiferous epithelium into the apical ( or adluminal ) and basal compartments so that meiosis i and ii and post - meiotic germ cell development can all take place in a specialized microenvironment in the apical compartment behind the btb . while the unusual anatomical features of the btb have been known for decades , the physiological function of the coexisting junctions , in particular the desmosome and gap junction , that constitute the btb was unknown until recently . based on recently published findings , we critically evaluate the role of the desmosome and gap junction that serve as a signaling platform to coordinate the """" opening """" and """" closing """" of the tj - permeability barrier conferred by tj and basal es during the seminiferous epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis . this is made possible by polarity proteins working in concert with nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases , such as focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) and c - src , at the site to regulate endosome - mediated protein trafficking events ( e . g ., endocytosis , transcytosis , recycling or protein degradation ). these events not only serve to destabilize the existing """" old """" btb above preleptotene spermatocytes in transit in """" clones """" at the btb , but also contribute to the assembly of """" new """" btb below the transiting spermatocytes . furthermore , hemidesmosomes at the sertoli cell - basement membrane interface also contribute to the btb restructuring events at stage viii of the epithelial cycle . additionally , the findings that a gap junction at the btb provides a possible route for the passage of toxicants [ e . g ., bisphenol a ( bpa )] and potential male contraceptives ( e . g ., adjudin ) across the btb also illustrate that these coexisting junctions , while helpful to maintain the immunological barrier integrity during the transit of spermatocytes , can be the """" gateway """" to making the btb so vulnerable to toxicants and / or chemicals , causing male reproductive dysfunction ."""	0
post - draw pan - pmma nanofiber reinforced and toughened bis - gma dental restorative composite .. objectives : the polyacrylonitrile ( pan )- poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) core - shell nanofiber reinforced dental composites have been investigated for their excellent interface adhesive , and this kind of novel dental composite has the potential for clinical uses such as denture base resin and crown - bridge material . the first objective of this work was to determine the improving effect of tensile properties by post - drawing pan - pmma nanofibers membrane . the second objective was to examine the flexural strength ( fs ), flexural modulus ( ey ) and work of fracture ( wof ) of bis - gma / tegdma composites reinforced with pan - pmma nanofibers . methods : pan ( core )- pmma ( shell ) nanofiber was made by an electrospinning setup with a high - speed rotating rod - like collector . the post - draw process was carried out at 120 degrees c for 5 min , and all the nanofiber membranes were elongated to the desired elongation ratio ( 30 %, 60 % or 100 %). tensile properties and flexural properties of both nanofiber membranes and nanofiber reinforced bis - gma / tegdma composites were investigated . a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) was used to observe the fiber morphology and the fracture surface of the composite . a dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer ( dmta ) was employed to determine the dynamic mechanical properties such as tandelta and e '. results : the post - drawing treatment significantly improved the tensile properties and fiber parallelism of nanofiber membranes . the addition of pan - pmma nanofibers into bis - gma / tegdma clearly showed the reinforcement effect ; the flexural strength ( fs ), flexural modulus ( ey ) and work of fracture ( wof ) kept rising with the nanofiber mass fraction changing from 0 %, 0 . 6 %, 0 . 8 %, 1 . 0 % to 1 . 2 %. the flexural properties of composites reinforced with post - drawn nanofiber were further increased in comparison with those of untreated nanofiber reinforced ones . also , the sem observations of the fracture surface of the composites demonstrated good interfacial adhesion between fibers and resin . significance : the post - drawing treatment was confirmed as a useful method for significantly increasing the tensile strength ( 673 . 4 %) and tensile modulus ( 875 . 3 %) of nanofiber membranes . in addition , the composites reinforced with post - drawn pan - pmma nanofibers exhibited higher fs ( 13 . 6 %), ey ( 5 . 3 %) and wof ( 30 . 4 %) than those reinforced with as - electrospun pan - pmma nanofibers . when 1 . 2 % mass fraction of post - drawn nanofibers were added to bis - gma / tegdma resin , the fs , ey and wof increased by 51 . 6 %, 64 . 3 % and 152 . 0 %, respectively , compared with neat resin .	0
open sandwich - based immuno - transistor for label - free and noncompetitive detection of low molecular weight antigen .. in this study , we proposed a new detection method , open sandwich - based immuno - field effect transistor ( os - fet ) for label - free and noncompetitive detection of low molecular weight antigen . the principle of os - fet is based on the detection of intrinsic molecular charges caused by the small antigen - dependent interchain interaction of separated v ( l ) and v ( h ) chains from a single antibody variable region using the field effect . introducing v ( h ) chain and small antigen bisphenol a into the os - fet with the immobilized v ( l ) chain on the gate , we could detect electrically and directly the binding of bisphenol a by v ( h ) and v ( l ) chains . although the detection limit of os - fet was 1 nm to detect bisphenol a for the standard deviation of control signal , the addition of isothiocyanobenzyl - edta with negative charges to the v ( l ) chain enhanced the detection limit to 1 pm . we could directly transduce the charge density changes based on the capture of target on the gate into the electrical signals using the os - fet . the platform based on the fets is suitable for a label - free , noncompetitive , and quantitative detection system for small antigen analysis in environmental , food , and clinical research .	0

microleakage and bond strength of sealant to primary enamel comparing air abrasion and acid etch techniques .. purpose : the objective of this study was to compare the effect of air abrasion ( kcp 2000 ), acid etching ( 37 % phosphoric acid ), and the combination of both procedures on the shear bond strength and microleakage of a light - cured pit - and - fissure sealant to the enamel of human primary molar teeth . methods : noncarious extracted human primary molars were randomly divided into 4 groups in preparation for enamel bonding . the enamel surface was treated as follows for each group : ( 1 ) group 1 ( control group ); ( 2 ) group 2 ( acid etch group ); ( 3 ) group 3 ( kcp [ kinetic cavity preparation system ] group ); and ( 4 ) group 4 ( kcp and acid etch group ). delton , a light - cured pit - and - fissure sealant , was then applied to the occlusal surface after conditioning . the bonded specimens were maintained in distilled water at 37 degrees c +/- 2 degrees c for 7 days , after which they were subjected to thermocycling followed by shear bond testing . microleakage was determined by immersing the prepared teeth in 50 % silver nitrate dye followed by sectioning and calculation of dye penetration . results : the mean shear bond strength of the kcp + acid etch group exhibited nearly 50 % higher bond strength than the acid etch group ( p <. 01 ). in addition , specimens bonded to enamel conditioned only with acid etch exhibited bond strengths that were nearly twice that of those conditioned with the kcp system alone . no significant difference was noted between the air abrasion and control groups . conclusions : in primary teeth , air abrasion combined with acid etching appears to provide the best conditions for enamel treatment prior to sealant placement .	0
stereo structure - controlled and electronic structure - controlled estrogen - like chemicals to design and develop non - estrogenic bisphenol a analogs based on chemical hardness concept .. the aim of this study was to elucidate the structure - activity relationship of bisphenol a ( bpa ) analogs using absolute hardness ( eta ) and absolute electronegativity ( chi ) ( chemical hardness ) and to design a non - estrogen active bpa . to determine the structure - activity relationships of bpa analogs , we investigated mcf - 7 cell proliferation stimulated by bpa analogs and an eta - chi diagram based on the electronic structure of the bpa analogs . the results show that the actions of the environmental hormones bpa analogs have two chemical properties ; ( i ) ' stereo structure - controlled ' and ( ii ) ' electronic structure - controlled ' estrogen - like chemical activities . therefore , we designed and synthesized bpa analogs which do not possess these 2 characteristics , (( i ) and ( ii )), and demonstrate the non - estrogen activity of the analog .	0
effect of chain modifications on the physicomechanical properties of silsesquioxane - based dental nanocomposites .. the objective of this study was to evaluate the physicomechanical properties of a series of polyhedral silsesquioxane ( ssq ) methacrylate monomers developed for dental applications . the effect of chain modifications on the properties of the ssq - based monomers was also evaluated . physicomechanical properties that are investigated include polymerization shrinkage , degree of conversion , hardness , and modulus . results obtained were compared with unfilled 1 : 1 ( control ) bis - gma / tegdma materials ( typical monomers used in dental composites ). all samples investigated were cured using 400 - 500 nm light at 500 mw / cm ( 2 ) for 40 s . shrinkage associated with curing and post - gel reactions for all synthesized ssq compounds were found to range from ( 0 . 04 +/- 0 . 01 )% to ( 0 . 33 +/- 0 . 03 )% with degree of conversion ranging from ( 56 . 68 +/- 2 . 81 )% to ( 84 . 53 +/- 2 . 62 )%. at all time intervals , post - gel shrinkage associated with control was found to be significantly greater than all ssq compounds . no significant difference in degree of conversion was observed for control , and all ssq compounds except for ssq attached with eight equivalents of short - chain methacrylate . mechanical properties associated with ssq compounds were found to be significantly lower than control . however , through chain modifications , mechanical properties of ssq compounds can be improved by approximately 50 %.	0

bisphenol - a : an estrogenic substance is released from polycarbonate flasks during autoclaving .. in studies to determine whether saccharomyces cerevisiae produced estrogens , the organism was grown in culture media prepared using distilled water autoclaved in polycarbonate flasks . the yeast - conditioned media showed the presence of a substance that competed with [ 3h ] estradiol for binding to estrogen receptors ( er ) from rat uterus . however , it soon became clear that the estrogenic substance in the conditioned media was not a product of the yeast grown in culture , but was leached out of the polycarbonate flasks during the autoclaving procedure . [ 3h ] estradiol displacement activity was monitored by er rra , and the active substance was purified from autoclaved medium using a series of hplc steps . the final purified product was identified as bisphenol - a ( bpa ) by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry . bpa could also be identified in distilled water autoclaved in polycarbonate flasks without the requirement of either the organism or the constituents of the culture medium . authentic bpa was active in competitive rras , demonstrating an affinity approximately 1 : 2000 that of estradiol for er . in functional assays , bpa ( 10 - 25 nm ) induced progesterone receptors in cultured human mammary cancer cells ( mcf - 7 ) at a potency of approximately 1 : 5000 compared to that of estradiol . the bpa effect on pr induction was blocked by tamoxifen . in addition , bpa ( 25 nm ) increased the rate of proliferation of mcf - 7 cells assessed by [ 3h ] thymidine incorporation . thus , bpa exhibited estrogenic activity by both rra and two functional bioresponse assays . finally , mcf - 7 cells grown in media prepared with water autoclaved in polycarbonate exhibited higher progesterone receptor levels than cells . grown in media prepared with water autoclaved in glass , suggesting an estrogenic effect of the water autoclaved in polycarbonate . our findings raise the possibility that unsuspected estrogenic activity in the form of bpa may have an impact on experiments employing media autoclaved in polycarbonate flasks . it remains to be determined whether bpa derived from consumer products manufactured from polycarbonate could significantly contribute to the pool of estrogenic substances in the environment .	0
activation of the mtor pathway by low levels of xenoestrogens in breast epithelial cells from high - risk women .. breast cancer is an estrogen - driven disease . consequently , hormone replacement therapy correlates with disease incidence . however , increasing male breast cancer rates over the past three decades implicate additional sources of estrogenic exposure including wide spread estrogen - mimicking chemicals or xenoestrogens ( xes ), such as bisphenol - a ( bpa ). by exposing renewable , human , high - risk donor breast epithelial cells ( hrbecs ) to bpa at concentrations that are detectable in human blood , placenta and milk , we previously identified gene expression profile changes associated with activation of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) pathway genesets likely to trigger prosurvival changes in human breast cells . we now provide functional validation of mtor activation using pairwise comparisons of 16 independent hrbec samples with and without bpa exposure . we demonstrate induction of key genes and proteins in the pi3k - mtor pathway -- akt1 , rps6 and 4ebp1 and a concurrent reduction in the tumor suppressor , phosphatase and tensin homolog gene protein . altered regulation of mtor pathway proteins in bpa - treated hrbecs led to marked resistance to rapamycin , the defining mtor inhibitor . moreover , hrbecs pretreated with bpa , or the xe , methylparaben ( mp ), surmounted antiestrogenic effects of tamoxifen showing dose - dependent apoptosis evasion and induction of cell cycling . overall , xes , when tested in benign breast cells from multiple human subjects , consistently initiated specific functional changes of the kind that are attributed to malignant onset in breast tissue . our observations demonstrate the feasibility of studying renewable human samples as surrogates and reinforce the concern that bpa and mp , at low concentrations detected in humans , can have adverse health consequences .	0
chronic oral exposure to bisphenol a results in a nonmonotonic dose response in mammary carcinogenesis and metastasis in mmtv - erbb2 mice .. background : bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a synthetic compound used to produce plastics and epoxy resins . bpa can leach from these products in appreciable amounts , resulting in nearly ubiquitous daily exposure to humans . whether bpa is harmful to humans , especially when administered orally in concentrations relevant to humans , is a topic of debate . objectives : in this study , we investigated the role of chronic oral exposure to bpa during adulthood on mammary carcinogenesis by using a transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops tumors through overexpression of wild - type erbb2 [ mouse mammary tumor virus ( mmtv )- erbb2 ]. methods : mmtv - erbb2 mice were exposed to 0 , 2 . 5 , 25 , 250 , or 2 , 500 µg bpa / l drinking water from 56 until 112 days of age ( for mechanism of action ) or 252 days of age ( for tumorigenesis ). cellular and molecular mechanisms of bpa action in the mammary gland were investigated via immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting . results : only low doses of bpa significantly decreased tumor latency and increased tumor multiplicity , tumor burden , and the incidence of metastasis . all bpa doses significantly increased the cell proliferation index , but only the higher doses also increased the apoptotic index in the mammary gland . at the molecular level , 25 µg bpa / l , but not 2 , 500 µg bpa / l , increased phosphorylation of erbb2 , erbb3 , insulin - like growth factor 1 receptor , and akt in the mammary gland . discussion : low , but not high , bpa doses significantly accelerated mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis in mmtv - erbb2 mice . the combined ratio of cell proliferation and apoptosis indices and alterations in protein expression best predicted the ability of each dose of bpa to alter tumorigenesis in this model .	0
structural evidence for endocrine disruptor bisphenol a binding to human nuclear receptor err gamma .. many lines of evidence reveal that bisphenol a ( bpa ) functions at very low doses as an endocrine disruptor . the human estrogen - related receptor gamma ( err gamma ) behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription , although the endogenous ligand is unknown . we have recently demonstrated that bpa binds strongly to err gamma ( k ( d ) = 5 . 5 nm ), but not to the estrogen receptor ( er ). bpa preserves the err gamma ' s basal constitutive activity , and protects the selective er modulator 4 - hydroxytamoxifen from its deactivation of err gamma . in order to shed light on a molecular mechanism , we carried out the x - ray analysis of crystal structure of the err gamma ligand - binding domain ( lbd ) complexed with bpa . bpa binds to the receptor cavity without changing any internal structures of the pocket of the err gamma - lbd apo form . the hydrogen bonds of two phenol - hydroxyl groups , one with both glu275 and arg316 , the other with asn346 , anchor bpa in the pocket , and surrounding hydrophobic bonds , especially with tyr326 , complete bpa ' s strong binding . maintaining the ' activation helix ' ( helix 12 ) in an active conformation would as a result preserve receptor constitutive activity . our results present the first evidence that the nuclear receptor forms complexes with the endocrine disruptor , providing detailed molecular insight into the interaction features .	0
long - term follow - up study of bioactive bone cement in canine total hip arthroplasty .. we report a long - term study of bioactive bone cement ( babc ) in a canine total hip arthroplasty ( tha ) at follow - up of 8 years . previous studies have shown excellent biomechanical and histological results at follow - up of 6 , 12 , and 24 months . in the present study , tha was performed in a beagle dog using babc consisting of an apatite - and wollastonite - containing glass ceramic ( aw - gc ) powder and sio2 powder as the filler and a bisphenol - a - glycidyl methacrylate ( bis - gma ) based resin as the organic matrix . histological examination showed direct bonding between babc and bone without any intervening soft tissue layer at the babc - bone interface . a reactive layer , through which babc bonded to the bone , was observed thicker at 8 years than it was at 24 weeks . no adverse effects of babc were observed . babc maintained the high bioactivity and direct bonding to bone in a canine tha at follow - up of 8 years .	0
biological monitoring of bisphenol a with hlpc / fld and lc / ms / ms assays .. biological monitoring is a necessary process for risk assessment of endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ), particularly , bisphenol a ( bpa ), in breast milk , because its human risks are not clear yet , and infants , who feed on breast milk , are highly susceptible for edcs . concerning biological monitoring of bpa , the hplc / fld has been widely used before the lc / ms / ms . however , there was no report , which simultaneously evaluated the two methods in real analyses . therefore , we analyzed bpa with lc / ms / ms and hplc / fld in human breast milk and conducted comparison of two methods in analyzed bpa levels . after establishing optimal condition , e . g . linearity , recovery , reproducibility and free bpa system , we analyzed bpa levels in human breast milk samples ( n = 100 ). the loqs were similar in the two methods , i . e . 1 . 8 and 1 . 3 ng / ml for the hplc / fld and lc / ms / ms assays , respectively . there were strong associations between total bpa levels with the two methods ( r ( 2 )= 0 . 40 , p < 0 . 01 ), however , only 11 % of them were analyzed as similar levels with 15 % cvs . in addition , the detection range of bpa was broader in the hplc method than the lc / ms / ms method . however , the bpa levels in the hplc / fld analysis were lower than those in the lc / ms / ms analysis ( p < 0 . 01 ). thus , the differences in bpa levels between the two methods may come from mainly over - estimation with the lc / ms / ms method in low bpa samples and some of poor resolution with the hplc / fld in high bpa samples .	0
aesthetic dental veneering materials .. they are numerous clinical indications for the use of aesthetic tooth coverings including heavily stained teeth , hypoplasia and other developmental disorders , and traumatic injuries . the acid etch technique provides a means of attaching composite resins and preformed acrylic veneers to enamel to cope with these problems . four basic techniques are in use : ( a ) freehand placement of cold - cured or light - cured acrylic resins , ( b ) use of a crown form with technique ( a ), ( c ) commercially performed acrylic laminated bonded to the tooth with cold - or light - cured resins and ( d ) individually made preformed laminates bonded as in ( c ). a meticulous acid etch technique is necessary , including the use of 35 per cent phosphoric acid for up to 120 seconds on difficult surfaces such as primary or highly fluorosed enamel . special care is needed at the gingival margin , for poor bonding is obtained by dentin / cementum . successful results can be obtained with all four techniques when experience has been gained . the quickest and most flexible technique is ( a ), whereas ( d ) is capable of the best contour , adaptation and aesthetics . however , in ( d ) laboratory procedures add to costs . the most convenient resins for freehand placement and bonding of veneers are the light - cured ( composite ) resins . cold - cure resins have short working time and are best used with an unfilled resin primer . clinical studies indicate that a life of at least 3 - 4 years for enamel veneers can be expected if incisal coverage is avoided . research is in progress to improve durability . these restorations should be regarded at present at medium - term treatments and should be so presented to the patient . even with current materials , a dramatic improvement in appearance can effect a major transformation in the self - esteem of the patient .	0
bonding amalgam to enamel : shear bond strength and sem morphology .. statement of problem : most studies of amalgam bonding have used dentin as the substrate . there is little data on bonding to enamel . purpose : this study evaluated the shear bond strength of amalgam to enamel with the use of 3 resin cements , 1 resin - modified glass ionomer lining cement , and 2 dentin bonding agents . material and methods : sixty bovine teeth were trimmed to expose a flat enamel surface and randomly assigned to 6 test groups of 10 specimens each . a single - plane lap shear test assembly was used . the enamel surfaces were treated with either amalgambond plus ( group i , control ), 2 coats of amalgambond plus ( group ii ), light - polymerized panavia f followed by an additional coat of autopolymerized panavia f ( group iii ), light - polymerized fuji lining lc followed by an additional coat of acid - base set fuji lining lc ( group iv ), clearfil se bond followed by an additional coat of autopolymerized panavia f ( group v ), or single bond followed by an additional coat of autopolymerized relyx arc ( group vi ). freshly mixed amalgam was condensed against the treated enamel surfaces . shear bond strengths for each group were compared with 1 - way anova and post hoc duncan ' s test ( p =. 05 ). fracture modes were examined visually . sem observations of the fractured enamel surfaces , interfacial morphology , and conditioned enamel surfaces for each group were performed . results : low bond strengths of 1 . 2 and 1 . 6 mpa were obtained in groups vi and i , respectively . the dual application of materials in all remaining groups resulted in higher bond strengths that ranged from 14 . 2 to 15 . 7 mpa . sem illustrations revealed various degrees of intermingling between the adhesive material and amalgam . the conditioned enamel surfaces were morphologically varied according to conditioning solution . conclusion : in this in vitro study , with the exception of group vi , the dual application of either adhesive resins or resin - modified glass ionomer resulted in satisfactory bond strengths of amalgam to enamel ( up to 16 mpa ).	0
a review of dietary and non - dietary exposure to bisphenol - a .. due to the large number of applications of bisphenol - a ( bpa ), the human exposure routes are multiple . we aimed to review shortly the food and non - food sources of bpa , and to evaluate their contribution to the human exposure . food sources discussed here include epoxy resins , polycarbonate and other applications , such as paperboard and polyvinylchloride materials . among the non - food sources , exposures through dust , thermal paper , dental materials , and medical devices were summarized . based on the available data for these exposure sources , it was concluded that the exposure to bpa from non - food sources is generally lower than that from exposure from food by at least one order of magnitude for most studied subgroups . the use of urinary concentrations from biomonitoring studies was evaluated and the back - calculation of bpa intake seems reliable for the overall exposure assessment . in general , the total exposure to bpa is several orders of magnitude lower than the current tolerable daily intake of 50 μg / kg bw / day . finally , the paper concludes with some critical remarks and recommendations on future human exposure studies to bpa .	0
comparison of a new bisphenol - a - glycidyl dimethacrylate - based cortical bone void filler with polymethyl methacrylate .. a newly formulated and reinforced bisphenol - a - glycidyl dimethacrylate ( bis - gma ) resin ( cortoss / orthovita , malvern , pa .) was compared with simplex p polymethyl methacrylate ( stryker howmedica osteonics , east rutherford , n . j .) in rabbits for up to 52 weeks and in sheep for up to 78 weeks . as seen in scanning electron microscopy and histology examinations , both implant materials were surrounded by bone at late time periods , with fibrous layers of connective tissue seen in half the simplex p specimens . no clinically significant safety differences between implant materials were apparent . interfacial bond strengths between the implant and bone generally increased with time , but were 4 . 5 - fold greater with cortoss than simplex p at 24 weeks , and 100 - fold greater at 52 weeks . forces required to displace 316ss rods held in place with cortoss were consistently greater than forces to displace rods held in place with simplex p . no statistically significant differences in displacement forces were found between rods held in place with cortoss polymerized in situ and rods held with prepolymerized cortoss . interfacial bond strengths were greater for simplex p that was polymerized in situ than for prepolymerized polymethyl methacrylate specimens . cortoss synthetic cortical bone void filler is a good candidate material to fix implants in bone . it has characteristics consistent with long - term safety and has a better ability to bond to bone than simplex p .	0
re - evaluation of the first synthetic estrogen , 1 - keto - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 - tetrahydrophenanthrene , and bisphenol a , using both the ovariectomised rat model used in 1933 and additional assays .. 1 - keto - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 - tetrahydrophenanthrene ( thp - 1 ) was reported by cook et al . in 1933 as the first synthetic estrogen . estrogenic activity was assessed by the induction of vaginal cornification in ovariectomised rats . the corresponding 4 - isomer ( thp - 4 ) was shown to be inactive . both chemicals have been re - synthesised and assessed for hormonal activity . each chemical bound weakly and to the same extent to isolated estrogen receptors , but only at high concentrations . however , they each lacked estrogenic or anti - estrogenic activity when evaluated in vitro using a yeast her assay , and both failed to induce vaginal cornification or uterotrophic effects in ovariectomised rats . thp - 1 , and to a lesser extent thp - 4 , were shown to possess weak androgenic and anti - androgenic activity in vitro when evaluated using an har yeast assay . estrogenic activity for bisphenol a ( bpa ) was subsequently demonstrated by [ dodds and lawson , synthetic , oestrogenic agents without the phenanthrene nucleus , nature 137 , ( 1936 )] using the same ovariectomised rat protocol , and this activity has been confirmed and supplemented by positive uterotrophic effects for bpa in the same bioassays . the present results illustrate the complexity of deriving conclusions regarding the hormonal activities of chemicals . first , some activities observed in isolated hormonal receptor binding assays may not be expressed in functional hormonal assays . this indicates the need for functional hormonal assays in any screening programme . second , that activities observed for a chemical in one hormonal assay may not be reflected in related hormonal assays . this indicates the need to define assay protocols with some precision when incorporating them into screening batteries . finally , that some literature reports of hormonal activity for chemicals may not be capable of independent confirmation under apparently identical conditions of test . this illustrates the need to use lists of hormonally active chemicals with care .	0
pulpal responses following direct pulp capping of healthy dog teeth with dentine adhesive systems .. objective : the aim of the present study was to evaluate the pulpal responses following direct pulp capping of mechanically exposed teeth with new dentine adhesive systems , in the preclinical model of dog teeth . methods : class v cavities ( approximately 2 . 50 mm wide , 3 . 00 mm long , 1 . 5 - 2 . 0 mm deep ) were prepared on the buccal surface of permanent maxillary and mandibulary molars , two rooted premolars , canines and third incisors . the cavities were assigned to five experimental groups , representing one control group treated with a ca ( oh ) 2 - based material and four experimental groups where the adhesive systems clearfil se bond , prompt - l - pop , etch & prime 3 . 0 and single bond were tested . the pulpal tissue responses to dentine adhesives were assessed at post - operative periods of 7 , 21 , 65 days . results : variable responses were recorded , which were characterized by moderate to severe inflammatory reactions , progressive extension of tissue necrosis with time and total absence of continuous hard tissue bridge formation after pulp capping with each of the four adhesive systems . application of a ca ( oh ) 2 - based material was characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration , limited tissue necrosis as well as partial to complete hard tissue bridging . conclusions : it seems evident that application of dentine adhesive systems in direct contact with the mechanically exposed pulp of healthy dog teeth cannot lead to acceptable repair of the dentine - pulp complex e . g . wound healing with tertiary dentine bridge formation .	0
effects of sodium ascorbate on microtensile bond strength of total - etching adhesive system to naocl treated dentine .. objective : the purpose of this study was to determine the microtensile bond strengths of total etching adhesive systems to pulpal chamber wall dentine after treated with various irrigants . methods : thirty extracted human third molars were cut horizontally to expose the pulp horn . the roof of the pulp chamber and pulp tissues were removed . the teeth were then divided into five groups of five specimens each to treat with various irrigants . specimens in each group were treated as follows : group 1 , with water for 10 min ; group 2 , with sodium hypochlorite for 10 min ; group 3 , with sodium hypochlorite for 10 min and water for 10 min ; group 4 , with sodium hypochlorite for 10 min and sodium ascorbate for 10 min ; group 5 , with sodium hypochlorite for 10 min , sodium ascorbate for 10 min and water 10 min . treated specimens were dried , bonded with a total - etching adhesive system ( single bond ) and restored with a resin composite ( z250 ) then kept for 24 h before determination of the microtensile bond strengths . results : group 2 ( 20 . 96 +/- 9 . 23 mpa ) demonstrated significantly lower bond strengths than group 1 ( 30 . 06 +/- 10 . 44 mpa ). no significant differences in bond strengths were found between group 3 ( 23 . 08 +/- 6 . 94 ) and group 2 . group 4 ( 40 . 55 +/- 8 . 99 ) demonstrated higher bond strengths than group 2 . however , there were no significant differences between group 5 ( 24 . 55 +/- 9 . 73 mpa ) and group 2 . conclusions : sodium hypochlorite significantly reduced the bond strengths of the adhesive when a total - etching was applied . the application of sodium ascorbate on sodium hypochlorite treated dentine significantly improved the bond strengths .	0
detection of acid diffusion through bovine dentine after adhesive application .. aim : acidic diffusion through bovine dentine was investigated by measuring ph changes on dentine surfaces after applying three adhesive systems . methodology : coronal incisor bovine dentine discs , 0 . 5 mm thick , were prepared from dentine close to the pulp chamber . a single - bottle adhesive system - single bond , a self - etching primer system - clearfil se bond and an ' all - in - one ' adhesive system - aq bond were used . the labial dentine surfaces were conditioned as follows : single bond groups : ( sb - 1 ) 35 % phosphoric acid etchant was applied and left in place ; ( sb - 2 ) the etchant was applied for 15 s and rinsed off for 10 s ; ( sb - 3 ) application of adhesive agent and light curing following step sb - 2 ; clearfil se bond groups : ( se - 1 ) se primer was applied for 20 s and dried ; ( se - 2 ) application of adhesive agent and light curing following step se - 1 ; aq bond groups : ( aq - 1 ) aq bond adhesive was applied for 20 s and dried , applied for additional 5 s and dried again ; ( aq - 2 ) light curing following step aq - 1 . the ph change on the pulpal dentine surface was measured using a ph - imaging microscope . results : all the single bond groups revealed a lower ph on the pulpal surface ( ph 6 . 25 , 6 . 59 and 6 . 64 for sb - 1 , sb - 2 and sb - 3 , respectively ) compared with intact dentine . clearfil se bond and aq bond groups showed no significant deference in ph value from intact dentine . conclusions : acid diffusion from phosphoric acid etching was observed when placed on 0 . 5 mm - thick dentine discs ; however , there was only limited evidence of acid diffusion from se primer and aq bond .	0
measurement of vitellogenin - mrna expression in primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes in a non - radioactive dot blot / rnase protection - assay .. the induction of vitellogenin synthesis both in vivo and in vitro has proven to be a reliable biomarker for assessing the estrogenic activity of individual substances and the more complex effluents of sewage treatment plants . however , due to the requirement of radioactively labelled nucleotides , the measurement of vitellogenin - mrna has not been widely used in routine testing -- even though this technique promises elevated sensitivity . in order to develop a practicable , reliable and cost - effective bioassay suitable for routine testing , a combined dot - blot / rnase protection assay , utilising digoxigenin - labelled crna transcripts of plasmid psg5vg1 . 1 was used for the quantification of vitellogenin - mrna in isolated rainbow trout ( oncorhynchus mykiss ) hepatocytes . by re - cloning the vg1 . 1 insert into a pgemzf7 (-)- vector , the sense - transcript of vg1 . 1 was utilized as a standard for the quantification of vitellogenin - mrna concentrations . male rainbow trout hepatocytes were cultured as monolayers in pure m199 medium . the addition of serum supplements did not result in increased expression of vitellogenin - mrna following 17 beta - estradiol administration . this indicates that for this assay no supplementation of the culture medium is necessary . after addition of 17 beta - estradiol , hepatocytes exhibited an exponential time - dependent expression of vitellogenin - mrna over a period of 144 h . the dot blot system was sufficiently sensitive to detect vitellogenin - mrna following addition of 1 microm 17 beta - estradiol after 6 h of incubation . however , the amount of vitellogenin - mrna expressed was found to be a function of both incubation time and inducer concentration . prolonged incubation times were therefore required to enhance the sensitivity of the system . after a 96 - h incubation , detection limits for 17 beta - estradiol were between 100 pm and 1 nm . vitellogenin - mrna could not be detected in untreated hepatocytes . the vitellogenin - mrna dot blot / rnase protection assay was further used as a tool for assessing the estrogenic potential of the xenoestrogens nonylphenol and bisphenol a , which exhibited estrogenic activities approximately 2000 - fold less than the natural inducer 17 beta - estradiol . the vitellogenin - mrna response to 17 alpha - ethinylestradiol reached maximum efficacy down to the lowest tested concentration of 10 (- 9 ) m . the assay also successfully identified estrogenic activity in selected waste water samples .	0
identification and estrogenic characterization of impurities in commercial bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ).. a sample of commercial badge was fractioned by hplc and eight impurities including novel propyl derivatives ( 2 ), ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) were identified by nmr spectrometry , fab - ms and gc - ms . the estrogenicity , both agonist and antagonist , of fractions containing these impurities was measured with a yeast two - hybrid assay incorporating the human ( her alpha ) and a competitive binding assay for her alpha ( elisa ). in the yeast two - hybrid assay , estrogenic antagonist activity was found in two fractions , while estrogenic agonist activity was not found in any . in the elisa method , the binding affinity to her alpha was found in three fractions . it is probable that a comprehensive assessment of the estrogenic properties of commercial badge , and their implications for human health , will require examination of all its components as described here .	0
effectiveness of fissure sealant retention and caries prevention with and without primer and bond .. objective : this study evaluated the effectiveness of sealant retention and caries prevention with and without primer and bond below the fissure sealant among kuwaiti schoolchildren . subjects and methods : this clinical trial used fissure sealant that was applied to four sound first permanent molars on 78 children . all the teeth were cleaned with pumice and rubber cups , isolated with rubber dams , and etched for 20 s . in a split - mouth study design , for the test teeth ( n = 156 ), primer and bond ( 3m scotchbond multi - purpose plus system primer and bond ) were applied below the sealant , and for the control teeth ( n = 156 ), only sealant ( delton plus ) was applied . the number of tooth surfaces included was 480 . due to loss to follow - up , only 60 children were evaluated at 5 years for sealant retention and caries . the evaluation criteria were : completely retained sealant , complete or partial sealant retention , and caries . results : in teeth sealed with primer and bond , 47 ( 19 . 6 %) tooth surfaces had completely retained sealant , 60 ( 9 . 2 %) teeth had partially retained sealant , while in 51 ( 21 . 3 %) caries was prevented and 120 ( 50 %) tooth surfaces were carious or filled . in teeth sealed without primer and bond , 25 % ( 60 tooth surfaces ) had completely retained sealant , 6 % ( 14 teeth surfaces ) had partially retained sealant , 26 % ( 54 teeth surfaces ) showed caries prevention , and 49 . 6 % ( 119 tooth surfaces ) were carious or filled . there was no difference between teeth sealed with primer and bond ( 120 teeth ) and teeth sealed without primer and bond ( 120 teeth ) in completely retained sealant ( p = 0 . 15 ), complete or partial sealant retention ( p = 0 . 6 ), caries prevented ( p = 0 . 37 ), and caries ( p = 0 . 93 ). conclusion : caries prevention was not enhanced in teeth sealed with primer and bond sealant compared with those sealed with sealant alone .	0

15 - deoxy - delta 12 - 14 - prostaglandin - j2 induces hypertrophy and loss of contractility in human testicular peritubular cells : implications for human male fertility .. the wall of the seminiferous tubules contains contractile smooth - muscle - like peritubular cells , thought to be important for sperm transport . impaired spermatogenesis in men typically involves remodeling of this wall , and we now found that smooth muscle cell ( smc ) markers , namely myosin heavy chain ( myh11 ) and smooth muscle actin ( sma ) are often lost or diminished in peritubular cells of testes of men with impaired spermatogenesis . this suggests reduced contractility of the peritubular wall , which may contribute to sub - or infertility . in these cases , testicular expression of cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) implies formation of prostaglandins ( pgs ). when screening different pgs for their ability to target human testicular peritubular cells ( htpcs ), only a pg metabolite , 15 - deoxy - delta ( 12 - 14 )- prostaglandin - j2 ( 15dpgj2 ), was effective . in primary cultures of htpcs , 15dpgj2 increased cell size in a reversible manner . importantly , 15dpgj2 treatment resulted in a loss of typical differentiation markers for smcs , namely myh11 , calponin , and sma , whereas fibroblast markers were unchanged . collagen gel contraction assays revealed that this loss correlates with a reduced ability to contract . experiments with an antagonist ( bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ) and agonist ( troglitazone ) for a cognate 15dpgj2 receptor ( i . e . peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ) indicated that peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma is not directly involved . rather , the mode of action of 15dpgj2 involves reactive oxygen species . the antioxidant n - acetylcysteine not only blocked ros formation but also prevented the increase in cell size and the loss of contractility in htpcs challenged with 15dpgj2 . we conclude that 15dpgj2 , via reactive oxygen species , influences smc phenotype and contractility of human peritubular cells and possibly is involved in the development of human male sub -/ infertility .	0
in ovo exposure to nonylphenol and bisphenol a resulted in dose - independent feminization of male gonads in japanese quail ( coturnix japonica ) embryos .. sex reversal effects of nonylphenol and bisphenol a on the gonads in f ( 1 ) ( awe × we ) japanese quail ( coturnix japonica ) embryos were investigated using an in vivo screening model developed previously . the f ( 1 ) ( awe × we ) japanese quail are a useful avian model because sex differentiation is confirmed by the plumage color before hatching , ruled by a criss - cross inheritance . the nonylphenol at 200 , 2 , 000 , 20 , 000 , and 200 , 000 ng / egg and bisphenol a at 20 , 200 , 2 , 000 , and 20 , 000 ng / egg were injected into the egg white just before incubation . at 16 d of incubation , embryos were subjected to a complete necropsy , and their gonads were both grossly observed and examined histopathologically and morphometrically . grossly , genetic sex was confirmed because plumage color coincided completely with the external sex phenotype of the gonads in all embryos . histopathologically , feminization of the male gonad , called ovotestis , developed in the left testis in all nonylphenol - and bisphenol a - treated groups . the incidence of the lesion in all treated groups was significantly higher than that in the control group , whereas there were no dose - dependent changes in the incidence and area of the ovotestis in both nonylphenol - and bisphenol a - treated groups . the present study revealed that nonylphenol and bisphenol a have a dose - independent potential of ovotestis induction in the japanese quail embryo .	0
ppargamma antagonists reverse the inhibition of neural antigen - specific th1 response and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by ciglitazone and 15 - deoxy - delta12 , 14 - prostaglandin j2 .. peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that regulates cell growth , differentiation and homeostasis . ppargamma agonists have been used to treat obesity , diabetes , cancer and inflammation and recent studies have shown the protective effects of ppargamma agonists on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis ( eae ), a th1 cell - mediated autoimmune disease model of multiple sclerosis ( ms ). our studies have further demonstrated that the ppargamma agonists , 15d - pgj2 and ciglitazone , inhibit eae through blocking il - 12 signaling leading to th1 differentiation and the ppargamma deficient heterozygous mice ( ppargamma +/-) or those treated with ppargamma antagonists develop an exacerbated eae in association with an augmented th1 response . in this study , we show that the ppargamma antagonists , bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) and 2 - chloro - 5 - nitro - n -( 4 - pyridyl ) benzamide ( t0070907 ), reverse the inhibition of eae by the ppargamma agonists , ciglitazone and 15 - deoxy - delta ( 12 , 14 )- prostaglandin j2 , in c57bl / 6 wild - type and ppargamma +/- mice . the reversal of eae by badge and t0070907 was associated with restoration of neural antigen - induced t cell proliferation , ifngamma production and th1 differentiation inhibited by ciglitazone and 15d - pgj2 . these results suggest that ciglitazone and 15d - pgj2 ameliorate eae through ppargamma - dependent mechanisms and further confirm a physiological role for ppargamma in the regulation of cns inflammation and demyelination in eae .	0
bisphenol a in combination with tnf - alpha selectively induces th2 cell - promoting dendritic cells in vitro with an estrogen - like activity .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a monomer used in manufacturing a wide range of chemical products , including epoxy resins and polycarbonate . bpa , an important endocrine disrupting chemical that exerts estrogen - like activities , is detectable at nanomolar levels in human serum worldwide . the pregnancy associated doses of 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) plus tumor - necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) induce distorted maturation of human dendritic cells ( dcs ) that result in an increased capacity to induce t helper ( th ) 2 responses . the current study demonstrated that the presence of bpa during dc maturation influences the function of human dcs , thereby polarizing the subsequent th response . in the presence of tnf - alpha , bpa treatment enhanced the expression of cc chemokine ligand 1 ( ccl1 ) in dcs . in addition , dcs exposed to bpa / tnf - alpha produced higher levels of il - 10 relative to those of il - 12p70 on cd40 ligation , and preferentially induced th2 deviation . bpa exerts the same effect with e2 at the same dose ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 microm ) with regard to dc - mediated th2 polarization . these findings imply that dcs exposed to bpa will provide one of the initial signals driving the development and perpetuation of th2 - dominated immune response in allergic reactions .	0
effect of prepolymerized composite megafiller on the marginal adaptation of composite restorations in cavities with different c - factors : an sem study .. aim : to evaluate the effect of prepolymerized custom - made composite megafiller and configuration factors ( c - factor ) on marginal adaptation of resin composite restorations . materials and methods : forty extracted human mandibular molars were divided into four experimental groups consisting of 10 samples each . in groups i and iii , class v ( configuration factor 5 ) and in groups ii and iv , class ii box - shaped cavities ( configuration factor 2 ) were prepared . groups i and ii were restored with a nanofilled composite ( filtek ™ z350 3m espe , st paul , mn , usa ) placed in horizontal increments . in groups iii and iv , preformed composite megafiller was placed and cavities were restored with nanofilled composite z - 350 . after curing , the samples were finished and prepared for examination under low vacuum scanning electron microscope . the data were analyzed with one - way analysis of variance . the significance between the individual groups was calculated by post hoc test using the holm - sidak method ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ). results : the marginal gap values in groups iii and iv were significantly lower than in groups i and ii , respectively ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ). minimum gap values were seen in group iv . conclusion : use of prepolymerized composite megafiller and a lower c - factor decreased the marginal gaps between the tooth and composite restorations .	0
primary cyclization in the polymerization of bis - gma and tegdma : a modeling approach to understanding the cure of dental resins .. an optimal dental restorative polymeric material would have a homogeneous cross - linking density giving it consistent mechanical strength throughout the material . when multifunctional monomers are polymerized , a pendant double bond can react intramolecularly with the radical on its propagating chain to form a loop , which results in a primary cyclization reaction . primary cyclization does not contribute to overall network structure , causes microgel formation , and leads to heterogeneity in the polymer . knowledge of how cure conditions control the degree of primary cyclization and cross - linking in the polymer is important in developing better dental materials . to gain more understanding about the evolving polymer network , the photopolymerization of a typical dental resin ( 75 / 25 wt % bis - gma / tegdma ) is modeled using a first principals approach . the overall polymerization rate behavior of 75 / 25 wt % bis - gma / tegdma is predicted using experimentally obtained propagation and termination kinetic rate constants . the effect of chain stiffness and light intensity on the polymerization kinetics is also explored . furthermore , the model predicts the extent of cross - linking and primary cyclization in the growing polymer network . at 45 % conversion , the fraction of bis - gma and tegdma pendant double bonds created that have cycled is 11 and 33 %, respectively . the model shows that using a stiff monomer , like bis - gma , in dental resins diminishes the extent of cyclization and increases the cross - linking density of the polymer . therefore , better mechanical properties are obtained than if more flexible monomers were used .	0
stearic acid protects primary cultured cortical neurons against oxidative stress .. aim : to observe the effects of stearic acid against oxidative stress in primary cultured cortical neurons . methods : cortical neurons were exposed to glutamate , hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ), or nan3 insult in the presence or absence of stearic acid . cell viability of cortical neurons was determined by mtt assay and ldh release . endogenous antioxidant enzymes activity [ superoxide dismutases ( sod ), glutathione peroxidase ( gsh - px ), and catalase ( cat )] and lipid peroxidation in cultured cortical neurons were evaluated using commercial kits . { 3 -[ 1 ( p - chlorobenzyl )- 5 -( isopropyl )- 3 - t - butylthiondol - 2 - yl ]- 2 , 2 - dimethylpropanoic acid , na } [ mk886 ; 5 micromol / l ; a noncompetitive inhibitor of proliferator - activated receptor ( ppar ) alpha ], bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ; 100 micromol / l ; an antagonist of ppar gamma ), and cycloheximide ( chx ; 30 micromol / l , an inhibitor of protein synthesis ) were tested for their effects on the neuroprotection afforded by stearic acid . western blotting was used to determine the ppar gamma protein level in cortical neurons . results : stearic acid dose - dependently protected cortical neurons against glutamate or h2o2 injury and increased glutamate uptake in cultured neurons . this protection was concomitant to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and to the promotion activity of cu / zn sod and cat in cultured cortical neurons . its neuroprotective effects were completely blocked by badge and chx . after incubation with h2o2 for 24 h , the expression of the ppar gamma protein decreased significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ), and the inhibitory effect of h2o2 on the expression of ppar gamma can be attenuated by stearic acid . conclusion : stearic acid can protect cortical neurons against oxidative stress by boosting the internal antioxidant enzymes . its neuroprotective effect may be mainly mediated by the activation of ppar gamma and new protein synthesis in cortical neurons .	0
urinary concentrations of bisphenol a in relation to biomarkers of sensitivity and effect and endocrine - related health effects .. the impact of endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) on human health is not yet clear because of difficulties in ascertaining their biological effects . in the present study , we evaluated exposure to the edc , bisphenol a ( bpa ), in 172 koreans in relation to biomarkers of susceptibility and effect . the subjects completed questionnaires , which documented occupation , education , lifestyle factors , potential sources of bpa - exposure , and the occurrence of self - diagnosed endocrine disorders . none of the subjects were occupationally exposed to bpa ; however , urinary levels of conjugated bpa , determined by hplc / fd , ranged from 0 . 03 - 62 . 4 microg / l ( median , 7 . 86 ). the frequencies of potential susceptibility biomarkers , the ugt1a6 - arg184ser and the sult1a1 - arg213his polymorphisms , were not associated with urinary bpa levels , either as single genes or in combination . indirect effects of bpa exposure on the susceptibility to mutagens were evaluated by comparing urinary bpa concentrations with mnng - induced sister - chromatid exchange ( sce ) in lymphocytes cultured from the subjects . bpa exposure showed marginal or significant associations with thesces induced by the low doses of mnng ( 0 - 0 . 4 mm ). however , there was no overall association between urinary bpa levels and mnng - induced frequency at doses ranging from 0 . 2 - 0 . 6 mm . finally , we did not detect an association between urinary bpa concentration and endocrine - related disorders . even though we were unable to find a strong association between bpa exposure and a biological response , possibly because of the limited number of subjects , we observed that most of the subjects were exposed to bpa . therefore , continuous biological monitoring of bpa is a prudent measure to prevent possible bpa - related health risks .	0
photosensitized oxidation of emerging organic pollutants by tetrakis c₆₀ aminofullerene - derivatized silica under visible light irradiation .. we recently reported that c ( 60 ) aminofullerenes immobilized on silica support ( aminoc ( 60 )/ silica ) efficiently produce singlet oxygen (( 1 ) o ( 2 )) and inactivate virus and bacteria under visible light irradiation . ( 1 ) we herein evaluate this new photocatalyst for oxidative degradation of 11 emerging organic contaminants , including pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen , carbamazepine , cimetidine , propranolol , ranitidine , sulfisoxazole , and trimethoprim , and endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol a and pentachlorophenol . tetrakis aminoc ( 60 )/ silica degraded pharmaceuticals under visible light irradiation faster than common semiconductor photocatalysts such as platinized wo ( 3 ) and carbon - doped tio ( 2 ). furthermore , aminoc ( 60 )/ silica exhibited high target - specificity without significant interference by natural organic matter . aminoc ( 60 )/ silica was more efficient than unsupported ( water - suspended ) c ( 60 ) aminofullerene . this was attributed to kinetically enhanced ( 1 ) o ( 2 ) production after immobilization , which reduces agglomeration of the photocatalyst , and to adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto the silica support , which increases exposure to ( 1 ) o ( 2 ) near photocatalytic sites . removal efficiency increased with ph for contaminants with a phenolic moiety , such as bisphenol a and acetaminophen , because the electron - rich phenolates that form at alkaline ph are more vulnerable to singlet oxygenation .	0
errgamma tethers strongly bisphenol a and 4 - alpha - cumylphenol in an induced - fit manner .. a receptor - binding assay and x - ray crystal structure analysis demonstrated that the endocrine disruptor bisphenol a ( bpa ) strongly binds to human estrogen - related receptor gamma ( errgamma ). bpa is well anchored to the ligand - binding pocket , forming hydrogen bonds with its two phenol - hydroxyl groups . in this study , we found that 4 - alpha - cumylphenol lacking one of its phenol - hydroxyl groups also binds to errgamma very strongly . the 2 . 0 a crystal structure of the 4 - alpha - cumylphenol / errgamma complex clearly revealed that errgamma ' s leu345 - beta - isopropyl plays a role in the tight binding of 4 - alpha - cumylphenol and bpa , rotating in a back - and - forth induced - fit manner .	0
screening of environmental contaminants for ecdysteroid agonist and antagonist activity using the drosophila melanogaster b ( ii ) cell in vitro assay .. the b ( ii ) bioassay was developed as a rapid and reliable tool for detecting potential insect growth regulators acting as ecdysteroid receptor ( ant ) agonists . based on an ecdysteroid - responsive cell line from drosophila melanogaster , this microplate assay is ideally suited to the evaluation of environmental contaminants as potential endocrine disrupters . data are presented for about 80 potential environmental contaminants , including industrial chemicals , pesticides , pharmaceuticals , phytoestrogens , and vertebrate steroids , and are compared with data for known ( ant ) agonists . apart from androst - 4 - ene - 3 , 17 - dione ( a weak antagonist ), vertebrate steroids were inactive at concentrations up to 10 (- 3 ) m . the vast majority of xenobiotics also showed no ( ant ) agonist activity . among the industrial chemicals , antagonistic activity was observed for bisphenol a median effective concentration ( ec50 ) of 1 . 0 x 10 (- 4 ) m and diethylphthalate ( ec50 of 2 . 0 x 10 (- 3 ) m ). some organochlorine compounds also showed weak antagonistic activity , including o , p '- dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( dde ), p , p '- dde , dieldrin , and lindane ( ec50 of 3 . 0 x 10 (- 5 ) m ). for lindane , bisphenol a , and diethylphthalate , activity is not associated with impurities in the samples and , for lindane and bisphenol a at least , the compounds are able to compete with ecdysteroids for the ligand binding site on the receptor complex , albeit at concentrations very much higher than those found in the environment . the only pharmaceutical showing any detectable antagonist activity was 17alpha - ethynylestradiol . in the context of recent publications on potential endocrine disruption in marine and freshwater arthropods , these findings suggest that , for some compounds ( e . g ., diethylstilbestrol ), ecdysteroid receptor - mediated responses are unlikely to be involved in producing chronic effects . the b ( ii ) assay has a potentially valuable role to play in distinguishing between endocrine - mediated , which normally occur at submicromolar concentrations , and pharmacological effects in insects and crustaceans .	0
occurrence of organic chemicals in two rivers inhabited by ozark hellbenders ( cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi ).. ozark hellbender ( cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi ) populations are in decrease throughout their native range with rare recruitment of young . increased estrogenic chemical levels and alterations of physicochemical properties in their habitat may play a significant role in this phenomenon . we report here the first systematic , comprehensive study of organic chemical concentrations and physical and nutrient parameters in two rivers containing ozark hellbender populations . water samples were collected monthly from august 2003 to november 2004 . concentrations of 21 organic chemicals were determined using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry . nine organic chemicals were detected . benzyl butyl phthalate , dibutyl phthalate , bisphenol a , and beta - sitosterol were all detected > 85 % of the time , with median concentrations of 18 to 234 ng / l and maximum concentrations of 198 to 4141 ng / l . individually , concentrations of nutrients and organic chemicals were much lower than those shown previously in laboratory and field experiments to have reproductive effects on amphibians . nevertheless , hellbenders are exposed to a variety of chemicals with potential estrogenic effects . our study establishes the basis to examine the specific effects of the detected concentrations , alone and in combination , on the ozark hellbenders .	0
mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite whisker - reinforced bis - gma - based resin composites .. objective : to evaluate the reinforcement efficacy of hydroxyapatite ( ha ) whiskers in bis - gma - based dental restorative composites and determine the effect of volume fraction on the mechanical properties . methods : silanized ha whiskers and nano - scale powder were mixed in various proportions with bis - phenol a - glycidyl methacrylate ( bis - gma )- based polymer pastes . equal parts of initiator and accelerator pastes were then mixed by hand . after curing at 25 ± 2 ° c and storage in distilled water at 37 ° c for 24h , elastic modulus , fracture strength and work - to - failure in three - point bending , fracture toughness using a notchless triangular prism fracture method , and vickers hardness were determined . data were examined by means of one - way analysis of variance and linear regression . results : reinforcing efficacy was significantly dependent on filler morphology . whiskers had good dispersibility and wettability with bis - gma - based polymer , conferring good reinforcement and toughening , significantly better than did the ha nano - scale powder . significance : ha whiskers provided better mechanical properties in bis - gma - based composites compared with the nano - scale powder . such whisker - reinforced materials may be beneficial compared with currently used dental restorative materials .	0
determination of physicochemical properties of tetrabromobisphenol a .. aqueous solubility ( sw ), 1 - octanol / water partition coefficient ( kow ), and vapor pressure of the nonionic form of 2 , 2 ', 6 , 6 '- tetrabromo - 4 , 4 '- isopropylidenediphenol ( tetrabromobisphenol a or tbbp - a ) were measured . from this , enthalpies of solution and vaporization were estimated . furthermore , enthalpy of fusion and melting point were measured to estimate subcooled liquid vapor pressure , the infinite dilution activity coefficient , and henry ' s law constant . since tbbp - a is expected to exit in both ionic and nonionic forms at near neutral ph , ph effects on physicochemical properties were also examined . because of the ionization of tbbp - a , sw increased by five orders of magnitude , while kow decreased by eight orders of magnitude . furthermore , an analytical model based on mass balance and dissociation of tbbp - a was applied to represent the ph dependence .	0
influence of crosshead speed on resin - dentin microtensile bond strength .. purpose : the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of testing speed on the microtensile bond strength values of two adhesive systems to dentin . materials and methods : a flat dentin surface was exposed after grinding the occlusal enamel of 10 human third molars . the adhesive systems ( n = 5 each ) single bond and clearfil se bond were applied according to the manufacturers ' instructions , and composite resin crowns ( z250 ) were constructed incrementally . after 24 h in distilled water at 37 degrees c , each tooth was longitudinally sectioned in both the x and y directions , under a cutting speed of 300 rpm , to obtain sticks with a cross - sectional area of 0 . 8 mm2 . the sticks from each tooth were divided into 5 groups to be tested under crosshead speeds of 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , 2 . 0 , and 4 . 0 mm / min . the fracture pattern was analyzed microscopically after debonding ( 400x ). a two - way anova having adhesive system ( 2 levels ) and testing speed ( 5 levels ) as main factors was used to compare the microtensile bond strengths . results : the two - way anova did not detect statistically significant differences either for the interaction ( p = 0 . 80 ) or for the crosshead speed ( p = 0 . 69 ). differences were only detected between adhesive systems ( p = 0 . 001 ), with single bond showing higher bond strength values than clearfil se bond . conclusion : the crosshead speed used for microtensile bond strength tests does not influence the bond strength values , regardless of the adhesive system employed .	0
effect of surface preparation on microtensile bond strength of three adhesive systems to bovine enamel .. purpose : the purpose of this study was to compare the microtensile bond strength ( microtbs ) of three adhesives to bovine enamel prepared with 600 - grit silicon carbide paper , diamond rotary instrument , or carbide bur . materials and methods : bovine teeth ( n = 36 ) were randomly divided into three treatment groups and bonded using a total - etch adhesive ( single bond , 3m espe ), a self - etching primer system ( clearfil se bond , kuraray ), or a self - etching adhesive ( one - up bond f , tokuyama ). a 4 - mm composite crown was built on the bonded surfaces and specimens were stored in water for one day at 37 degrees c . specimens were sectioned into 0 . 7 - mm - thick slabs , trimmed to a cross - sectional area of 1 mm2 , and loaded to failure at a crosshead speed of 1 mm / min using a tabletop tester ( ez - test , shimadzu ). microtensile bond strength data were analyzed using anova and fisher ' s plsd test ( alpha = 0 . 05 ). results : the bond strength of each self - etching system was lower when the enamel was prepared using a diamond or carbide bur , rather than with 600 - grit silicon carbide paper . differences in microtbs between carbide - and diamond - prepared surfaces were not significant . the surface preparation method did not affect the total - etch system . conclusion : different preparation instruments are unlikely to affect resin - enamel bond strengths .	0
the role of cavity preparation and conditioning in the leakage of restorations .. purpose : restoration microleakage is thought to be determined by the method and location of cavity preparation , enamel etching , and dentin conditioning , as well as the restorative material . this study compared the microleakage of composite restorations placed in preparations cut with carbide and diamond burs and those treated with different bonding / conditioning agents . materials and methods : class v preparations ( 3 x 2 x 2 mm ) were cut wholly in enamel or in enamel and cementum in 100 human premolars . twenty teeth were prepared with carbide burs and the preparations etched and conditioned with prime & bond nt but not restored . a second set of 20 teeth had enamel - only preparations cut with carbides ( n = 10 ) or diamonds ( n = 10 ), and the preparations etched , conditioned ( prime & bond nt ) and restored with prisma tph . the other 60 teeth were divided into 3 groups of 20 teeth each with enamel - only ( n = 10 ) or enamel / cementum preparations ( n = 10 ). the 3 groups of teeth were conditioned with optibond solo , clearfil se bond or prompt - l - pop prior to restoration with prisma tph . two mm of root was resected from all teeth , pulpal tissue removed , and insulated copper wires inserted via the root canals to contact with the pulp chamber roof before the tooth - wire interfaces and root surfaces were sealed . the teeth were immersed in 0 . 9 % nacl and leakage assessed over 30 d by ir drop across a resistor in series with a dc source and stainless - steel counter electrode . results : differences ( p < 0 . 05 ) in leakage were found for enamel preparations cut with carbides and diamonds , and the relationship of leakage vs time was linear . enamel / cementum preparations showed greater leakage , and the relationship of leakage vs time was sigmoidal . conditioned - only preparations showed the same leakage as those conditioned and restored , while preparation leakage varied with the conditioning agent . conclusion : cavity preparation location , method of cutting , and the conditioning agent markedly affect leakage behavior .	0
effect of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ligands on the expression of retinoic acid - inducible gene - i in endothelial cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide .. retinoic acid - inducible gene - i ( rig - i ) is a member of the dexh box protein family and designated as a putative rna helicase . rig - i is implicated in host defense and inflammatory reactions by regulating the expression of various genes . rig - i is expressed in endothelial cells and upregulated with lipopolysaccharide ( lps ). peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( ppar - gamma ) is a nuclear hormone receptor and regulates gene expressions in response to its specific ligands . in the present study , we examined the effect of ppar - gamma ligands on the lps - induced rig - i expression in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvec ). 15 - deoxy - delta ( 12 , 14 )- prostaglandin j2 ( 15d - pgj2 ), a metabolite of pgd2 , is a natural ligand for ppar - gamma and known to modulate inflammatory reactions by regulating the expression of various genes in ppar - gamma - dependent and - independent manners . lps - induced rig - i expression in huvec was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with 15d - pgj2 in time - and concentration - dependent manners . however , ciglitazone and bisphenol a diglycide ether , authentic and specific ligands for ppar - gamma , did not affect the rig - i expression . these results suggest that 15d - pgj2 inhibits lps - induced rig - i expression through a mechanism independent on ppar - gamma . 15d - pgj2 may regulate inflammatory reactions , at least in part , by inhibiting the expression of rig - i .	0
microtensile bond strength of self - etching adhesives to enamel and dentin .. purpose : to measure the microtensile bond strength to enamel and dentin of three self - etching adhesives in comparison with a total - etch two - step system as a control . materials and methods : a total of 40 extracted human molars were stored in saline solution until use , then divided into 4 groups of 10 teeth ( one group per adhesive system ). half of each of these groups underwent bond strength tests on enamel , and the other half was used for adhesion testing on dentin . the following experimental groups ( n = 5 ) were then formed : e ( 1 ) adper prompt - l - pop ( ap , 3m espe ) on enamel ; e ( 2 ) xeno cf ii ( x , sanking kogyo ) on enamel ; e ( 3 ) adhese ( as , ivoclar - vivadent ) on enamel ; e ( 4 ) excite ( ex , ivoclar - vivadent ) on enamel ; d ( 1 ) ap on dentin ; d ( 2 ): x on dentin ; d ( 3 ) as on dentin ; d ( 4 ) ex on dentin . each tooth yielded 15 to 20 sticks about 0 . 9 x 0 . 9 mm in cross - sectional area for microtensile testing . specimens were loaded in tension at a crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / minute , and bond strength at failure was calculated in mpa . a two - way anova was applied to test for significance of the differences among the groups . results : the bond strength values of excite ( the control ) were significantly higher than those of the test products on enamel ( 42 . 92 +/- 4 . 8 mpa ) and on dentin ( 45 . 80 +/- 5 . 79 mpa ). the self - etching adhesives adhese ( 28 . 48 +/- 4 . 71 mpa ) and xeno cf ii ( 27 . 22 +/- 2 . 74 mpa ) revealed significantly stronger adhesion than adper prompt - l - pop ( 20 . 16 +/- 2 . 07 mpa ) on dentin . on enamel , all self - etching test materials performed similarly . the substrate did not appear to have a significant influence on adhesion , as each material reached comparable levels of bond strength on enamel and dentin . conclusion : on both substrates the self - etching adhesives tested performed significantly worse than did the total - etch system .	0
effect of multiple application of a dentin adhesive on contraction gap width of a resin - based composite .. purpose : to test the efficacy of the multiple application of a total - etch dentin adhesive was investigated by measuring ( 1 ) the contraction gap width of a light - activated resin - based composite in a cylindrical dentin cavity and ( 2 ) the early tensile bond strength to a flat dentin surface with the single bond dental adhesive system . materials and methods : contraction gap width was measured in a cylindrical dentin cavity ( 3 mm x 1 . 5 mm ) treated with a single coat or double coats of the single bond adhesive and restored with silux plus or z - 100 . as control , the cavity was treated with an experimental dentin bonding system consisting of edta , 35 % gm and clearfil photo bond . early tensile bond strengths of silux plus or z - 100 were measured on the flat dentin surface treated with the three bonding procedures as in the contraction gap study within 10 min . after final cure . results : the contraction gap of silux plus and z - 100 was prevented with the double coats of the single bond adhesive , whereas the contraction gap of z - 100 was not prevented with the single coat of the single bond and the experimental system . when the film thickness of the single bond system was less than 2 microm , the gap could not be prevented . the tensile bond strengths of silux plus and z - 100 to flat dentin mediated with the three bonding procedures were not significantly different ( p > 0 . 05 ).	0
bisphenol - a , an environmental estrogen , activates the human orphan nuclear receptor , steroid and xenobiotic receptor - mediated transcription .. background : there is increasing concern about endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) which may produce adverse health effects in humans and other species . one such chemical , bisphenol - a ( bpa ), a monomer of polycarbonate plastics , is widely used in consumer products ; it has been reported to contain estrogenic activity through binding to estrogen receptors . cytochrome p450 mono - oxygenase 3a4 ( cyp3a4 ) is one of the key enzymes for the metabolism of endogenous steroids and foreign chemicals in liver . the orphan nuclear receptor , steroid and xenobiotic receptor ( sxr / pxr ), has recently been isolated . a variety of known inducers of cyp3a4 bind to sxr / pxr , and stimulate transcription on xenobiotic - response elements ( xres ) located in the promoter region of the cyp3a4 gene . recent study has shown that edcs , diethylhexylphthalate ( dehp ) and nonylphenol , but not bpa , induce mouse sxr / pxr - mediated transcription . however , it is known that species differences in sxr alter cyp3a inducibility . objective : to test whether bpa stimulates human sxr / pxr - mediated transcription using reporter gene assays . methods : transfection assays were performed with human sxr / pxr expression plasmid and a reporter plasmid containing the xres in the cyp3a4 gene promoter in hepg2 cells . bpa - induced interaction of human sxr / pxr with steroid receptor coactivator - 1 ( src - 1 ) was analyzed by mammalian two - hybrid assays . results : bpa , as well as dehp , activated human sxr - mediated transcription on the xres . in mammalian two - hybrid assays , bpa recruited src - 1 to the ligand - binding domain of human sxr / pxr . conclusions : our observations have indicated that bpa may be a human - specific inducer of the cyp3a4 gene , and may influence the metabolism of endogenous steroids , drugs , and other xenobiotics .	0
assessing the estrogenic potency in a portuguese wastewater treatment plant using an integrated approach .. the estrogenic potency of a wastewater treatment plant ( wwtp ) was evaluated using chemical and biological analyses , which showed that after the station treatment processes some of the selected endocrine disruptor compounds ( edcs ) were still present in the treated effluent ( e . g ., bisphenol a , alkylphenols , estrone ). thus , the most common endocrine edcs were identified and quantified and the overall estrogenicity of the treated effluent assessed by integrating the results . male goldfish ( carassius auratus ) were used as biological indicators in a 28 - day experiment . vitellogenin ( vtg ), gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices , steroids ( 17beta - estradiol and 11 - ketotestosterone ) and histopathology were biomarkers used in fish to evaluate wwtp treated effluent estrogenicity , in combination with instrumental analyses . the results showed a significant increase ( p < 0 . 01 ) in plasma and liver vtg , which were significantly correlated ( r = 0 . 66 ; p < 0 . 01 ). the gonadosmatic index was significantly ( p < 0 . 01 ) reduced in exposed fish . the steroid analyses revealed significant elevations in 17beta - estradiol and depressed 11 - ketotestosterone concentrations . the histological examinations show changes in exposed fish gonads , such as regressed testes and in some cases ( 43 % to 75 %) the development of ovo - testis in fish exposed to 50 % and 100 % treated effluent .	0
effects of various light curing methods on the leachability of uncured substances and hardness of a composite resin .. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the various light curing units ( plasma arc , halogen and light - emitting diodes ) and irradiation methods ( one - step , two - step and pulse ) using different light energy densities on the leachability of unreacted monomers ( bis - gma and udma ) and the surface hardness of a composite resin ( z250 , 3m ). leachability of the specimens immersed for 7 days in ethanol was analysed by hplc . vicker ' s hardness number ( vhn ) was measured immediately after curing ( ic ) and after immersion in ethanol for 7 days . various irradiation methods with three curing units resulted in differences in the amount of leached monomers and vhn of ic when light energy density was lower than 17 . 0 j cm (- 2 ) ( p = 0 . 05 ). however , regardless of curing units and irradiation methods , these results were not different when the time or light energy density increased . when similar light energy density was irradiated ( 15 . 6 - 17 . 7 j cm (- 2 )), the efficiency of irradiation methods was different by the following order : one - step > or = two - step > pulse . these results suggest that the amount of leached monomers and vhn were influenced by forming polymer structure in activation and initiation stages of polymerization process with different light source energies and curing times .	0
endocrine disruptors and human corpus luteum : in vitro effects of phenols on luteal cells function .. endocrine disruptors are well known to impair fertility . the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of bisphenol a ( bpa ) and nonylphenol ( p - np ) on human luteal function in vitro . in particular , in luteal cells isolated from 21 human corpora lutea progesterone , prostaglandin ( pg ) f2α , pge2 and vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) release , as well as vegf expression were evaluated . bpa and p - np negatively affected both luteal steroidogenesis and luteotrophic / luteolytic factors balance , without influencing vegf mrna expression . actually , bpa and p - np impaired human luteal cells function in vitro , underlining the already suggested correlation between phenols and reproductive failure .	0
simultaneous photocatalytic reduction of cr ( vi ) and oxidation of bisphenol a induced by fe ( iii )- oh complexes in water .. simultaneously photocatalytic reduction of cr ( vi ) and oxidation of bisphenol a ( bpa ) in aqueous solution in the presence of fe ( iii )- oh complexes were investigated under a 250 w metal halide lamp ( lambda > or = 365 nm ). synergy effect of the simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and reduction of both pollutants was achieved . the effects of initial ph value , initial concentration of bpa , cr ( vi ) and fe ( iii ) were preliminarily investigated . the results showed that both photocatalytic reduction of cr ( vi ) and degradation of bpa could occur simultaneously in the fe ( iii )/ cr ( vi )/ bpa ternary system , and the rates of photocatalytic reduction of cr ( vi ) and the oxidation of bpa were more rapid at a low ph range of 2 . 0 - 3 . 0 . the increase of the initial concentration of fe ( iii ) was favorable to both photocatalytic reduction of cr ( vi ) and oxidation of bpa . the reduction efficiency of cr ( vi ) decreased with increasing initial concentrations of cr ( vi ) and bpa , but the degradation efficiency of bpa was not changed obviously at different cr ( vi ) concentrations .	0
genotoxicity of the coating lacquer on food cans , bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ), its hydrolysis products and a chlorohydrin of badge .. the epoxy resin bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ), its hydrolysis products and a chlorohydrin of badge ( badge . 2hcl ), were examined for their genotoxicity in the micronucleus test ( mnt ) with human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro , in presence and in absence of an exogenous metabolizing system s9 rat liver . the treatment was done using different compound concentrations up to cytotoxic doses . the concentrations tested ranged between 12 . 5 to 62 . 5microg / ml of badge , 12 . 5 to 62 . 5microg / ml of first badge hydrolysis product ( badge . h ( 2 ) o ), 25 . 0 to 100 . 0microg / ml of second badge hydrolysis product ( badge . 2h ( 2 ) o ) and 6 . 25 to 50 . 0microg / ml of badge . 2hcl . these compounds are able to induce both cytotoxic and genotoxic effects , as revealed by the increases observed in cytokinesis block proliferation index ( cbpi ) and in micronuclei ( mn ) frequencies , respectively .	0
occurrence of bisphenol a in surface water , drinking water and plasma from malaysia with exposure assessment from consumption of drinking water .. this study investigated the level of bisphenol a ( bpa ) in surface water used as potable water , drinking water ( tap and bottled mineral water ) and human plasma in the langat river basin , malaysia . bpa was present in 93 % of the surface water samples at levels ranging from below limit of quantification ( loq ; 1 . 3 ng / l ) to 215 ng / l while six fold higher levels were detected in samples collected near industrial and municipal sewage treatment plant outlets . low levels of bpa were detected in most of the drinking water samples . bpa in tap water ranged from 3 . 5 to 59 . 8 ng / l with the highest levels detected in samples collected from taps connected to pvc pipes and water filter devices . bottled mineral water had lower levels of bpa ( 3 . 3 ± 2 . 6 ng / l ) although samples stored in poor storage condition had significantly higher levels ( 11 . 3 ± 5 . 3 ng / l ). meanwhile , only 17 % of the plasma samples had detectable levels of bpa ranging from 0 . 81 to 3 . 65 ng / ml . the study shows that bpa is a ubiquitous contaminant in surface , tap and bottled mineral water . however , exposure to bpa from drinking water is very low and is less than 0 . 01 % of the tolerable daily intake ( tdi ).	0
synthesis of hybrid carbon nanotubes using brassica juncea l . application to photodegradation of bisphenol a .. hyperaccumulators contain tubular cellulose and heavy metals , which can be used as the sources of carbon and metals to synthesize nanomaterials . in this paper , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ), cu ( 0 . 05 ) zn ( 0 . 95 ) o nanoparticles , and cnts / cu ( 0 . 05 ) zn ( 0 . 95 ) o nanocomposites were synthesized using brassica juncea l . plants , and the ultraviolet ( uv )- light - driven photocatalytic degradations of bisphenol a ( bpa ) using them as photocatalysts were studied . it was found that the outer diameter of cnts was around 50 nm and there were a few defects in the crystal lattice . the synthesized cu ( 0 . 05 ) zn ( 0 . 95 ) o nanocomposites had a diameter of around 40 nm . cu ( 0 . 05 ) zn ( 0 . 95 ) o nanocomposites have grown on the surface of the cnts and the outer diameter of them was around 100 nm . the synthesized hybrid carbon nanotubes using b . juncea could enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation on bpa . the complete equilibration time of adsorption / desorption of bpa onto the surface of cnts , cu ( 0 . 05 ) zn ( 0 . 95 ) o nanoparticles , and cnts / cu ( 0 . 05 ) zn ( 0 . 95 ) o nanocomposites was within 30 , 20 , and 30 min , and approximately 14 . 9 , 8 . 7 , and 17 . 4 % bpa was adsorbed by them , respectively . the combination of uv light irradiation ( 90 min ) with cnts , cu ( 0 . 05 ) zn ( 0 . 95 ) o nanoparticles , and cnts / cu ( 0 . 05 ) zn ( 0 . 95 ) o nanocomposites could lead to 48 . 3 , 75 . 7 , and 92 . 6 % decomposition yields of bpa , respectively . these findings constitute a new insight for synthesizing nanocatalyst by reusing hyperaccumulators .	0
three - year occlusal wear of posterior composite restorations .. the specific aims of this study were to : 1 ) measure the occlusal wear of four different dental composite materials placed in the posterior teeth of adults ; and 2 ) evaluate the effect of the clinical parameters , cavity class and tooth type on occlusal wear . four different visible light - cured composite materials were used to make the restorations in this study . the restorations placed for this randomized clinical trial were scored through the use of an indirect evaluation system ( m - l scale ). the total sample size per recall ranged from 90 to 142 restorations from baseline to 36 months . the mean wear at 36 months for heliomolar , j & j experimental ( adaptic ii ) and p - 30 was 45 - 54 microns , which is rather low compared to the recently reported wear of other composite materials . marathon exhibited significantly greater wear with a mean of 174 microns at 36 months . the data also showed that cavity class and tooth type had no significant effect on the occlusal wear of the restorations made with the three low wear - rate materials , while restorations composed of the high wear - rate material exhibited more wear in molars than premolars ; this effect was again not statistically significant . these data support the hypothesis that the overall wear of a composite restoration is more dependent on the material ' s properties than clinical parameters such as cavity class and tooth type .	0
behaviour and fate of nine recycled water trace organics during managed aquifer recharge in an aerobic aquifer .. the fate of nine trace organic compounds was evaluated during a 12month large - scale laboratory column experiment . the columns were packed with aquifer sediment and evaluated under natural aerobic and artificial anaerobic geochemical conditions , to assess the potential for natural attenuation of these compounds during aquifer passage associated with managed aquifer recharge ( mar ). the nine trace organic compounds were bisphenol a ( bpa ), 17β - estradiol ( e2 ), 17α - ethynylestradiol ( ee2 ), n - nitrosodimethylamine ( ndma ), n - nitrosomorpholine ( nmor ), carbamazepine , oxazepam , iohexol and iodipamide . in the low organic carbon content spearwood sediment , all trace organics were non - retarded with retardation coefficients between 1 . 0 and 1 . 2 , indicating that these compounds would travel at near groundwater velocities within the aquifer . the natural aerobic geochemical conditions provided a suitable environment for the rapid degradation for bpa , e2 , iohexol ( half life < 1day ). lag - times for the start of degradation of these compounds ranged from < 15 to 30days . while iodipamide was persistent under aerobic conditions , artificial reductive geochemical conditions promoted via the addition of ethanol , resulted in rapid degradation ( half life < 1days ). pharmaceuticals ( carbamazepine and oxazepam ) and disinfection by - products ( ndma and nmor ) did not degrade under either aerobic or anaerobic aquifer geochemical conditions ( half life > 50days ). field - based validation experiments with carbamazepine and oxazepam also showed no degradation . if persistent trace organics are present in recycled waters at concentrations in excess of their intended use , natural attenuation during aquifer passage alone may not result in extracted water meeting regulatory requirements . additional pre treatment of the recycled water would therefore be required .	0
thyroid effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals .. in recent years , many studies of thyroid - disrupting effects of environmental chemicals have been published . of special concern is the exposure of pregnant women and infants , as thyroid disruption of the developing organism may have deleterious effects on neurological outcome . chemicals may exert thyroid effects through a variety of mechanisms of action , and some animal experiments and in vitro studies have focused on elucidating the mode of action of specific chemical compounds . long - term human studies on effects of environmental chemicals on thyroid related outcomes such as growth and development are still lacking . the human exposure scenario with life long exposure to a vast mixture of chemicals in low doses and the large physiological variation in thyroid hormone levels between individuals render human studies very difficult . however , there is now reasonably firm evidence that pcbs have thyroid - disrupting effects , and there is emerging evidence that also phthalates , bisphenol a , brominated flame retardants and perfluorinated chemicals may have thyroid disrupting properties .	0
tensile bond strength of resin luting cement to glass infiltrated porous aluminium oxide cores ( in - ceram ).. the effect of various methods of surface treatment of glass infiltrated aluminium oxide ( in - ceram ) on tensile bond strength was evaluated . test specimens were formed as bars . after surface treatment of the flat ends , two bars were bonded together with either a dual curing resin ( twinlook ) or a chemical curing resin with a phosphate monomer ( panavia ex ). after cementation the specimens were stored in humid conditions for 1 week and then thermocycled 1 , 000 times between 15 degrees c and 60 degrees c . the highest median tensile bond strengths were obtained with the silicoater md - method without the opaquer and twinlook as luting agent ( 23 . 9 mpa ) or with sandblasting with 250 micrometers al2o3 particles and panavia ex as luting agent ( 22 . 0 mpa ).	0
[ hygienic standards of the occupational air quality established by the experts on chemical agents , 2002 ].. in 2002 , it was necessary to harmonize polish law on admissible limits of occupational exposure with eu requirements . to this end , the expert group on chemical agents proposed maximum admissible concentration values for 29 chemicals : acrylaldehyde ( 107 - 02 - 8 ); cresols , mix of isomers ( 95 - 48 - 7 ), 108 - 39 - 4 , 106 - 44 - 5 , 1319 - 77 - 3 ); tetraphosphorus decaoxide ( 1314 - 56 - 3 ); ethylamine ( 75 - 04 - 7 ); naphtalene ( 91 - 20 - 3 ); nitrobenzene ( 98 - 95 - 3 ); nitrogen oxide ( 110 - 54 - 5 ); nitrogen dioxide ( 10102 - 44 - 0 ); pyridine ( 110 - 86 - 1 ); butan - 2 - one ( 78 - 93 - 3 ); carbon oxide ( 630 - 08 - 0 ); 1 , 4 - dichlorobenzene ( 106 - 46 - 7 ); 1 , 2 - dichlorobenzene ( 95 - 50 - 1 ); hexane ( 110 - 54 - 5 ); aluminum hydroxide ( 21645 - 51 - 2 ); aluminum ( fumes and dusts ) ( 7429 - 90 - 5 ); amitrole ( 61 - 82 - 5 ); 2 , 2 - bis ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) propane ( bisphenol a ) ( 80 - 05 - 7 ); 3a , 4 , 7 , 7a - terahydro - 4 , 7 - metanoindene ( dicyclopentadiene ) ( 77 - 73 - 6 ); trimethoxyphosphane ( 121 - 45 - 9 ); methyl chloroacetate ( 96 - 34 - 4 ); 4 - methoxyphenol ( 150 - 76 - 5 ); methyl formate ( 107 - 31 - 3 ); 2 - phenoxyethanol ( 122 - 99 - 6 ); divinylbenzene ( 1321 - 74 - 0 ); diesel exhausts (-); hexane - 6 - lactam ( dusts and fumes ) ( 105 - 60 - 2 ); 2 - isopropoxyethanol ( 109 - 59 - 1 ); and methyl 2 - cyanoacrylate ( 137 - 05 - 3 ).	0
biological assessment of bisphenol a degradation in water following direct photolysis and uv advanced oxidation .. endocrine disrupting compounds ( edcs ) are exogenous environmental chemicals that can interfere with normal hormone function and present a potential threat to both environmental and human health . the fate , distribution and degradation of edcs is a subject of considerable investigation . to date , several studies have demonstrated that conventional water treatment processes are ineffective for removal of most edcs and in some instances produce multiple unknown transformation products . in this study we have investigated the use of direct photolysis with low - pressure ( lp ) hg uv lamps and uv + hydrogen peroxide ( h ( 2 ) o ( 2 )) advanced oxidation process ( aop ) for the degradation of a prototypic endocrine disrupter , bisphenol a ( bpa ), in laboratory water . removal rates of bpa and formation of degradation products were determined by high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) analysis . changes in estrogenic activity were evaluated using both in vitro yeast estrogen screen ( yes ) and in vivo vitellogenin ( vtg ) assays with japanese medaka fish ( oryzias latipes ). our results demonstrate that uv alone did not effectively degrade bpa . however , uv in combination with h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) significantly removed bpa parent compound and aqueous estrogenic activity in vitro and in vivo . removal rates of in vivo estrogenic activity were significantly lower than those observed in vitro , demonstrating differential sensitivities of these bioassays and that certain uv / aop metabolites may retain estrogenic activity . furthermore , the uv / h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) aop was effective for reducing larval lethality in treated bpa solutions , suggesting bpa degradation occurred and that the degradation process did not result in the production of acutely toxic intermediates .	0
multidimensional screening and design of pharmaceuticals by using endocrine pharmacophores .. a novel computational technology derived from gene structure has been developed for screening , selecting , and designing pharmaceutical candidates . pharmacophores , or three - dimensional molecular blueprints , were created by docking known active structures into specific sites in partially unwound dna . the pharmacophores are composites of the van der waals surfaces and hydrogen bonding functional groups of active molecules . once created , molecules can be inserted into the pharmacophores and degree of fit quantitated by the volume of the molecule that fits within the composite surface and the magnitude of electrostatic interactions with charged atoms on the pharmacophore . here , we describe endocrine pharmacophores and in particular the estrogen pharmacophore derived by docking active ligands into partially unwound dna . fit of candidate structures into the estrogen pharmacophore correlated with estrogenic ( uterotropic ) activity . for example , the super active estrogens moxestrol and 11beta - acetoxyestradiol fit better within the site than estradiol . bisphenol a , a putative endocrine disrupter with suspected estrogenic activity , was a poor fit in the pharmacophore . consistent with this prediction , bisphenol a was recently shown to lack uterotropic activity . the capacity of the endocrine pharmacophores to predict certain nontarget activities was demonstrated by using the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate that did not fit the estrogen or thyroid pharmacophores but fit partially into the progestin and glucocorticoid pharmacophores . cyproterone acetate has been reported to have weak progestational and glucocorticoid activities . the pharmacophores provide for the first time a multidimensional computational method that can simultaneously predict multiple activities of diverse molecular structures .	0
xenoestrogens released from lacquer coatings in food cans .. we present data showing that some foods preserved in lacquer - coated cans and the liquid in them may acquire estrogenic activity . hormonal activity was measured using the e - screen bioassay . the biological activity of vegetables packed in cans was a result of plastic monomers used in manufacturing the containers . the plastic monomer bisphenol - a , identified by mass spectrometry , was found as a contaminant not only in the liquid of the preserved vegetables but also in water autoclaved in the cans . the amount of bisphenol - a in the extracts accounted for all the hormonal activity measured . although the presence of other xenoestrogens cannot be ruled out , it is apparent that all estrogenic activity in these cans was due to bisphenol - a leached from the lacquer coating . the use of plastic in food - packaging materials may require closer scrutiny to determine whether epoxy resins and polycarbonates contribute to human exposure to xenoestrogens .	0
occupational allergic contact dermatitis from bisphenol a in vinyl gloves .. allergic contact dermatitis caused by polyvinyl chloride gloves is rarely reported , and in only 2 cases was bisphenol a considered to be the responsible sensitizer . we report a patient with occupational hand dermatitis after the use of a new type of high - density vinyl ( hdv ) gloves . patch tests showed positive (++) reactions to both used and new hdv gloves and to bisphenol a . chemical analysis by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of bisphenol a in the hdv gloves . replacement by nitrile rubber gloves resulted in complete clearance of the hand dermatitis .	0
effect of endocrine disrupters on thymocytes in vitro .. in a previous paper we reported that endocrine disrupters ( eds ) such as 4 , 4 '- isopropylidene diphenol ( bisphenol a : bpa ), bis ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( ehp ) stimulated proliferative responses and cytokine productions of murine spleen cells in vitro . in this paper we report our studies on the effect of eds on murine thymocytes in vitro . eds such as bpa , ehp and diethyl stilbesterol enhanced the proliferative responses of thymocytes . the proliferative responses of in vitro precultured thymocytes with eds were markedly enhanced by the secondary stimulation with syngeneic spleen cells as antigen - presenting cells ( syngeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction ; mlr ), when compared with thymocytes precultured without eds . the responder cells were t cells , and they recognized the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class ii antigens on the antigen - presenting cells . the precultured t cells with eds were enhanced in the production of cytokines such as interleukin ( il )- 3 , il - 4 and interferon - gamma . these results suggest that eds have a modulating activity on thymocyte functions .	0
substances released from dental resin composites and glass ionomer cements .. an increasing number of cavities in the primary and permanent dentition is restored with tooth - colored materials , especially dental resin composites or glass ionomer cements . several investigations have revealed that various components are segregated from different composite filling materials into an aqueous environment after polymerization . most organic substances can be extracted from a set resin by organic solvents ( methanol , tetrahydrofuran , ethanol ). furthermore , in most studies , the co - monomer teg - dma has been identified as the main compound released from polymerized resin composites into aqueous media . however , small quantities of the monomers ( bis - gma , udma ) and other co - monomers , as well as additives , may also be released into water . very little data have been published about substances released from various types of glass ionomer cements ( gic ), except the liberation of fluoride . erosion studies have revealed that there is a considerable disintegration of gics at lower ph - values . however , the nature of the eroded substances has not yet been clarified . altogether , the data presented in this review indicate that information is comparably scarce for resin composites and gics in comparison to the rich amount of knowledge concerning amalgams . therefore , further studies are necessary to determine quality and quantity of substances segregated from resin composites and gics .	0
potential estrogenic effects of bisphenol - a estimated by in vitro and in vivo combination assays .. the potential estrogenic activities of bisphenol - a were investigated in vitro ( e - screen and estrogen receptor competitive binding bioassays ) and in vivo ( uterotrophic assay ). uterotrophic responses were evaluated using mature ovariectomized sprague - dawley female rats treated subcutaneously with bisphenol a ( 1 , 5 , 10 , 50 , and 100 mg / kg / day ), e2 ( 0 . 3 microgram / kg ), and des ( 0 . 3 microgram / kg ) for 3 consecutive days . in a mcf - 7 cell proliferation assay , e2 and des used as positive estrogens induced maximum proliferation of mcf - 7 cells at 1 . 0 nm , whereas bpa slightly induced mcf - 7 cell proliferation at a higher level of 0 . 1 microm and maximum proliferation at 10 microm . in a competitive binding assay , e2 and des showed inhibition of 17 beta -[ 3h ] estradiol binding to the rat uterus er with an ic50 of 1 . 0 nm and 0 . 5 nm , respectively . however , bpa had an ic50 of 5 microm , which was approximately 5 , 000 or 10 , 000 - fold greater than the ic50 of e2 and des . in uterotrophic assays , uterus ( wet and blotted ) and vagina weights were significantly increased at the dose of bpa 100 mg / kg / day in ovx sprague - dawley rats . these studies demonstrate that bpa exhibits weak estrogenic activity in all experimental systems , and thus its migration from epoxy resins or polycarbonate products should be controlled not to exceed a safety levels for humans .	0
exposure to environmental and lifestyle factors and attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children - a review of epidemiological studies .. attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children . although the mechanisms that lead to the development of adhd remain unclear , genetic and environmental factors have been implicated . these include heavy metals and chemical exposures , nutritional and lifestyle / psychosocial factors . the aim of this review was to investigate the association between adhd or adhd - related symptoms and widespread environmental factors such as phthalates , bisphenol a ( bpa ), tobacco smoke , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ), polyfluoroalkyl chemicals ( pfcs ) and alcohol . medline , pubmed and ebsco search was performed to identify the studies which analyze the association of prenatal and postnatal child exposure to environmental toxicants and lifestyle factors and adhd or adhd - related symptoms . the review is restricted to human studies published since 2000 in english in peer reviewed journals . despite much research has been done on the association between environmental risk factors and adhd or adhd symptoms , results are not consistent . most studies in this field , focused on exposure to tobacco smoke , found an association between that exposure and adhd and adhd symptoms . on the other hand , the impact of phthalates , bpa , pfcs , pahs and alcohol is less frequently investigated and does not allow a firm conclusion regarding the association with the outcomes of interest .	0
angiotensin ii induces peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma in pc12w cells via angiotensin type 2 receptor activation .. the angiotensin type 2 ( at2 ) receptor has been previously demonstrated to exert neuroprotective actions possibly by inducing neuronal cell differentiation involving neurite outgrowth . the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( ppargamma ) is an important transcriptional regulator of cell differentiation . the aim of the present study was to clarify whether ppargamma is involved in at2 - receptor - mediated morphological neuronal cell differentiation . to investigate at2 - receptor - mediated morphological neuronal cell differentiation , rat pheochromocytoma cells ( pc12w cells ) expressing at2 but not at1 receptors , were stimulated with angiotensin ii ( ang ii , 100 nmol / l ) +/- the ppargamma antagonists gw9662 ( 3 micromol / l ) and bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge , 1 micromol / l ), and neurite outgrowth of these cells was assessed . ang ii induced neurite outgrowth by 19 +/- 1 . 6 - fold ( p < 0 . 01 ). antagonizing ppargamma activity by gw9662 or badge potently blocked ang ii - induced neurite outgrowth ( ang ii + gw9662 : 6 . 6 +/- 1 . 5 - fold , p < 0 . 05 ; ang ii + badge : 1 . 3 +/- 0 . 7 - fold , p < 0 . 01 ). at2 receptor activation by ang ii markedly induced mrna and protein expression of the ppargamma2 isoform and enhanced ligand - induced ppargamma activity in transactivation assays . in conclusion , the present study demonstrates that ang ii induces ppargamma expression and ligand - mediated ppargamma activity via at2 receptor activation , which appears to be a crucial process in at2 receptor mediated neurite outgrowth . at2 receptor / ppargamma - dependent neurite outgrowth may play an important role during neuroprotective processes .	0
[ the differences in absorption and metabolism of bisphenol a between rats and mice ].. objective : to investigate the mechanism of the different levels of serum bisphenol a ( bpa ) between rat and mouse after oral administration . methods : a total of 18 specific pathogen free ( spf ) male rats and 18 mice were treated with 300 mg / kg bpa by oral administration , blood samples were taken from rats and mice after bpa administration at 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , 12 . 0 h time points ( n = 6 at each point ). serum bpa levels were quantified using fluorescence - high performance liquid chromatography ( fl - hplc ) analysis . the rats and mice ( n = 6 , respectively ) were perfused with 100 ml of 0 . 1 mmol / l bpa by intestinal absorption in situ , then the bpa levels of perfusion fluid at 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , 2 . 0 h time points and serum at 2 . 0 h after bpa perfusion were determined by fl - hplc analysis . the levels of udp - glucuronosyltransferase 2b1 ( ugt2b1 ) mrna expression in the liver of rats and mice were analyzed by semi - quantitative rt - pcr and ugt2b1 enzymatic activity was determined by fl - hplc method . the rats and mice ( n = 6 , respectively ) were treated with 300 mg / kg bpa by oral administration after fasting 24 h , the feces were collected during 24 h and the levels of bpa in feces were determined by fl - hplc analysis . results : at 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , 12 . 0 h after oral administration at 300 mg / kg bpa , the levels of serum bpa in mice (( 66 . 57 ± 14 . 95 ), ( 51 . 16 ± 16 . 06 ), ( 22 . 73 ± 5 . 00 ) µg / ml , respectively ) were significantly higher than in rats (( 15 . 63 ± 5 . 65 ), ( 18 . 34 ± 5 . 02 ), ( 7 . 65 ± 2 . 58 ) µg / ml , respectively ) ( f values were 50 . 660 , 17 . 957 , 8 . 420 , respectively , p < 0 . 05 ), the rates of absorption in mice small intestine during 0 h -, 0 . 5 h -, 1 . 0 - 2 . 0 h (( 10 . 20 ± 4 . 20 ), ( 1 . 49 ± 0 . 67 ), ( 1 . 31 ± 0 . 55 ) µg × cm (- 2 ) × min (- 1 ), respectively ) were higher than that in rats (( 1 . 87 ± 0 . 69 ), ( 0 . 47 ± 0 . 13 ), ( 0 . 36 ± 0 . 08 ) µg × cm (- 2 ) × min (- 1 ), respectively ) ( f values were 14 . 954 , 8 . 877 , 11 . 536 , respectively , p < 0 . 05 ), the serum bpa levels in mice (( 22 . 64 ± 4 . 35 ) µg / ml ) were significantly higher than in rats (( 4 . 13 ± 0 . 83 ) µg / ml ) after 2 h perfusion with 0 . 1 mmol / l bpa ( f = 74 . 643 , p = 0 . 000 ), the levels of ugt2b1 mrna expression and enzymatic activity in the rats liver were obviously higher than in the mice liver . after oral administration at 300 mg / kg bpa , the feces bpa levels of rats (( 1 . 50 ± 0 . 32 ) mg / g ) were significantly higher than that of the mice (( 0 . 57 ± 0 . 35 ) mg / g ) ( f = 21 . 215 , p = 0 . 001 ) during 24 h . conclusion : the serum bpa level of mouse is significantly higher than the rat after oral administration at 300 mg / kg bpa , which may be caused by bpa high absorption rate of mouse small intestine and strong ability of bpa glucuronidation and excretion of the rat .	0
anaerobic - aerobic process for microbial degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a .. tetrabromobisphenol a ( tbbpa ) is a flame retardant that is used as an additive during manufacturing of plastic polymers and electronic circuit boards . little is known about the fate of this compound in the environment . in the current study we investigated biodegradation of tbbpa , as well as 2 , 4 , 6 - tribromophenol ( tbp ), in slurry of anaerobic sediment from a wet ephemeral desert stream bed contaminated with chemical industry waste . anaerobic incubation of the sediment with tbbpa and peptone - tryptone - glucose - yeast extract medium resulted in a 80 % decrease in the tbbpa concentration and accumulation of a single metabolite . this metabolite was identified by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ) as nonbrominated bisphenol a ( bpa ). on the other hand , tbp was reductively dehalogenated to phenol , which was further metabolized under anaerobic conditions . bpa persisted in the anaerobic slurry but was degraded aerobically . a gram - negative bacterium ( strain wh1 ) was isolated from the contaminated soil , and under aerobic conditions this organism could use bpa as a sole carbon and energy source . during degradation of bpa two metabolites were detected in the culture medium , and these metabolites were identified by gc - ms and high - performance liquid chromatography as 4 - hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 - hydroxyacetophenone . both of those compounds were utilized by wh1 as carbon and energy sources . our findings demonstrate that it may be possible to use a sequential anaerobic - aerobic process to completely degrade tbbpa in contaminated soils .	0
relation of enamel prism orientation to microtensile bond strength .. purpose : to evaluate the effect of enamel prism orientation on microtensile bond strengths ( mtbs ) to enamel using two current bonding systems . materials and methods : the crown segments of extracted human third molars were cut mesio - distally to obtain buccal and lingual halves . one of the halves was cut horizontally at the middle of the crown to make a flat enamel surface parallel to prism orientation ( parallel specimen ). the other half was ground at the equator of the crown to produce a flat enamel surface perpendicular to the prism orientation ( perpendicular specimen ). each surface was ground with 600 grit silicone carbide paper , treated with clearfil liner bond iisigma ( lb ) or single bond ( sb ) according to the manufacturers ' instructions and resin composite , ap - x or z100 , respectively , was built up onto it . after storage in water at 37 degrees c for 24 hours , all bonded specimens were sectioned and trimmed for measuring mtbs . in mtbs , the parallel specimens were stressed perpendicular to the prism long axis and the perpendicular specimens were stressed parallel to the prism axis . results : mtbs of specimens stressed perpendicular to the prism long axis were 11 . 93 +/- 5 . 56 mpa for lb and 10 . 97 +/- 1 . 80 mpa for sb . mtbs of specimens stressed parallel to the prism axis in lb and sb were 19 . 07 +/- 6 . 35 mpa and 23 . 99 +/- 9 . 20 mpa , respectively . for each prism orientation , no difference in mtbs was found between the bonding systems ( p > 0 . 05 ). both systems showed lower mtbs in specimens stressed perpendicular to the prism long axis than in specimens stressed parallel to the prism axis .	0
effect of water quality on the bonding of resin to moist dentin .. purpose : to test the effect of different water samples , used for rinsing the dentin , following acid conditioning , on the bond strength of a resin - based composite ( rbc ) restorative material ( z100 ), to dentin using a one - bottle dentin adhesive ( single bond ). materials and methods : in preliminary experiments two experimental shear bond strength methods were compared , and one was selected which was deemed to permit more uniform application of the adhesive and better light curing . in the definitive experiments there were five experimental groups , according to rinsing water used ( 1 ) distilled water as control , ( 2 ) water with 3 . 5 ppm iodine , ( 3 ) water 3 . 0 ppm sodium hypochlorite , ( 4 ) water with 2 % ethanol , ( 5 ) water contaminated with 6 x 10 ( 4 ) cfu / ml of e . coli bh5v . for each experimental group the shear bond strength to moist dentin from 10 human intact impacted third molars was measured . the dentin samples were etched , washed and gently blotted to leave the dentin moist . following application of the adhesive and resin , specimens were stored at 37 degrees c for 24 hours prior to testing in an instron testing machine at a rate of 0 . 5 mm / minute . results : data ( in mpa +/- standard deviation ) were : group 1 : 21 . 2 +/- 4 . 1 ; group 2 : 20 . 8 +/- 5 . 6 ; group 3 : 21 . 8 +/- 6 . 2 ; group 4 : 22 . 9 +/- 5 . 9 ; group 5 : 19 . 6 +/- 5 . 5 . these data support the null hypothesis that the water types used in this work had no significant effect on the bonding of a resin composite to dentin ( p = 0 . 74 , anova ).	0
synthesis and estrogenic activity of bisphenol a mono - and di - beta - d - glucopyranosides , plant metabolites of bisphenol a .. the syntheses and characterization of bisphenol a mono - and di - beta - d - glucopyranosides were undertaken to confirm that these compounds are major plant metabolities of bisphenol a ( bpa ) and to allow an assessment of their estrogenicity . synthesis involved the glucosidation of unprotected bpa with glucose penta - acetate with phosphorus oxychloride as catalyst . the estrogenic activity of bpa and its mono - and di - beta - d - glucopyranosides were measured with an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa )- based estrogen receptor competitive binding assay and with a yeast two - hybrid assay adapted to a chemiluminescent reporter gene ( for beta - galactosidase ). both methods showed that the estrogenicity of bpa was eliminated by formation of the di - glucoside , but whereas the elisa - based method indicated that reduced activity remained in the monoglucoside , the yeast two - hybrid method showed the monoglucoside to be inactive . presumably these results reflect the more complex interactions of test compound and cellular components required to demonstrate estrogenicity in the yeast two - hybrid assay . as these processes parallel those in mammalian cells , the yeast two - hybrid method is likely to be the more realistic assay . the uptake and metabolism of bpa by plants offers the possibility of phytoremediation of contaminated water , but also provides an additional route for the compound to enter the human food chain .	0
ethanol wet - bonding challenges current anti - degradation strategy .. the long - term effectiveness of chlorhexidine as a matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) inhibitor may be compromised when water is incompletely removed during dentin bonding . this study challenged this anti - bond degradation strategy by testing the null hypothesis that wet - bonding with water or ethanol has no effect on the effectiveness of chlorhexidine in preventing hybrid layer degradation over an 18 - month period . acid - etched dentin was bonded under pulpal pressure simulation with scotchbond mp and single bond 2 , with water wet - bonding or with a hydrophobic adhesive with ethanol wet - bonding , with or without pre - treatment with chlorhexidine diacetate ( chd ). resin - dentin beams were prepared for bond strength and tem evaluation after 24 hrs and after aging in artificial saliva for 9 and 18 mos . bonds made to ethanol - saturated dentin did not change over time with preservation of hybrid layer integrity . bonds made to chd pre - treated acid - etched dentin with commercial adhesives with water wet - bonding were preserved after 9 mos but not after 18 mos , with severe hybrid layer degradation . the results led to rejection of the null hypothesis and highlight the concept of biomimetic water replacement from the collagen intrafibrillar compartments as the ultimate goal in extending the longevity of resin - dentin bonds .	0
nanoleakage inhibition within hybrid layer using new protective chemicals and their effect on adhesion .. hybrid - layer degradation occurs because of acidic properties of currently used adhesive systems . titanium tetrafluoride couples with tooth surface , and titanium compounds are not substituted . caffeic acid phenethyl esther inhibits endogenous matrix metalloproteinases that cause hybrid - layer degradation . it was hypothesized that titanium tetrafluoride and caffeic acid phenethyl esther application on exposed dentine surfaces before adhesive applications would inhibit nanoleakage and hybrid - layer degradation without compromising the bond strength of the adhesives . in ultracut thin sections , human dentine - chemical agent - adhesive composite interfaces were observed under transmission electron microscope with complementary scanning electron microscopy . microtensile bond strength tests were also accomplished . titanium tetrafluoride and titanium tetrafluoride + caffeic acid phenethyl esther applications decreased bond strength values . caffeic acid phenethyl esther showed decreased silver nitrate penetration for cements based on bisphenol glycydilmethacrylate and methyl methacrylate , whereas cement based on 4 - methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride methyl methacrylate showed almost no infiltration . caffeic acid phenethyl esther application before cementation could inhibit nanoleakage and biodegradation of the hybrid layer .	0
effect of moist bonding on composite / enamel bond strength .. purpose : to evaluate the effect of moist bonding on shear bond strength of resin - based composite to enamel using different adhesive systems . materials and methods : six restorative systems were selected for this study : optibond fl / prodigy , solid bond / charisma f , syntac single component / tetric , prime & bond 2 . 1 / spectrum tph , single bond / z100 , etch & prime 3 . 0 / degufill mineral . flat enamel surfaces were ground on the buccal and lingual aspects of 80 extracted human molars . optibond fl and solid bond were tested with and without primer application . prior to application of the adhesives , the enamel was either carefully dried with compressed air ( dry bonding ) or blot dried with a cotton pellet ( moist bonding ). shear bond strength was determined with a universal testing machine after 24 - hour storage in 0 . 9 % nacl at 37 degrees c . results : moist bonding did not significantly affect shear bond strength to enamel of the adhesives tested except for solid bond without primer application . primer contamination of the etched enamel did not significantly influence bond strength , neither in the dry bonding nor in the moist bonding group . of all adhesives tested in both groups , the highest mean bond strength was observed with prime & bond 2 . 1 and the lowest with etch & prime 3 . 0 .	0
gpr30 , the non - classical membrane g protein related estrogen receptor , is overexpressed in human seminoma and promotes seminoma cell proliferation .. background : testicular germ cell tumours are the most frequent cancer of young men with an increasing incidence all over the world . pathogenesis and reasons of this increase remain unknown but epidemiological and clinical data have suggested that fetal exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors ( eeds ) with estrogenic effects , could participate to testicular germ cell carcinogenesis . however , these eeds ( like bisphenol a ) are often weak ligands for classical nuclear estrogen receptors . several research groups recently showed that the non classical membrane g - protein coupled estrogen receptor ( gper / gpr30 ) mediates the effects of estrogens and several xenoestrogens through rapid non genomic activation of signal transduction pathways in various human estrogen dependent cancer cells ( breast , ovary , endometrium ). the aim of this study was to demonstrate that gper was overexpressed in testicular tumours and was able to trigger jkt - 1 seminoma cell proliferation . results : we report here for the first time a complete morphological and functional characterization of gper in normal and malignant human testicular germ cells . in normal adult human testes , gper was expressed by somatic ( sertoli cells ) and germ cells ( spermatogonia and spermatocytes ). gper was exclusively overexpressed in seminomas , the most frequent testicular germ cell cancer , localized at the cell membrane and triggered a proliferative effect on jkt - 1 cells in vitro , which was completely abolished by g15 ( a gper selective antagonist ) and by sirna invalidation . conclusion : these results demonstrate that gper is expressed by human normal adult testicular germ cells , specifically overexpressed in seminoma tumours and able to trigger seminoma cell proliferation in vitro . it should therefore be considered rather than classical ers when xeno - estrogens or other endocrine disruptors are assessed in testicular germ cell cancers . it may also represent a prognosis marker and / or a therapeutic target for seminomas .	0
partitioning of endocrine disrupting compounds in inland waters and wastewaters discharged into the coastal area of thessaloniki , northern greece .. background , aim , and scope : in the water framework directive 2000 / 60 / ec , environmental objectives for the proper quality of inland , surface , transitional , coastal , and ground waters have been set . member states are required to identify chemical pollutants of significance in the water bodies , to establish emission control measures , and to achieve quality standards . a specific category of pollutants are the compounds that may possess endocrine - related functions known as endocrine disrupting compounds ( edcs ). this means that member states have the obligation to take action in order to prevent human exposure to these compounds via aquatic environment . the objective of this research was to study the occurrence and distribution of phenolic and steroid edcs in inland waters and wastewaters discharged in the area of thermaikos gulf , thessaloniki , northern greece . materials and methods : samples were collected from three rivers , four streams , and four municipal and industrial wastewaters from the area of thessaloniki , northern greece , during the period 2005 - 2006 . the samples were analyzed for 14 edcs ( nonylphenol , octylphenol , their mono - and di - ethoxylate oligomers , bisphenol a , estrone , 17alpha - estradiol , 17beta - estradiol , estriol , mestranol , and 17alpha - ethynylestradiol ). the compounds were recovered by solid phase extraction and ultrasonic extraction from the dissolved phase and particulate phase , respectively , and determined by employing gas chromatography - mass spectrometry . results : results revealed the presence of phenolic edcs ( np , np1eo , np2eo , top , op1eo , op2eo , and bpa ) in all water and wastewater samples . steroid edcs were not found at detectable concentrations . the relationships between field partition coefficients of edcs and concentration of total suspended solids , dissolved , and particulate organic carbon were investigated . discussion : rivers exhibited concentrations of edcs similar to minimally impacted surface waters worldwide . the concentrations of np and op occasionally exceeded the environmental quality criteria proposed for inland waters . the concentrations of edcs in streams exhibited wide variations due to low flow rate in these systems and the impact of wastewaters from various pollution sources . wastewater from tannery activities showed extremely high concentrations of np , whereas relatively high concentrations of edcs were determined in effluents from the industrial wastewater treatment plant . field partition coefficients of edcs are negatively correlated with concentrations of total suspended solids and dissolved organic carbon and positively correlated with particulate organic carbon . conclusions : the examined rivers ( aliakmon , axios , and loudias ) exhibited concentrations of edcs similar to minimally impacted surface waters worldwide . however , special attention should be paid to these systems since the concentrations for np and op occasionally were above the proposed quality standards , revealing the impact of urban , industrial , and agricultural activities . high concentrations of edcs were determined in streams , urban , and industrial wastewater posing significant risk to the aquatic environment they discharged . recommendations and perspectives : the occurrence of edcs in inland waters and wastewaters discharged to thermaikos gulf results in an increased risk to the marine environment . thus , these systems should be regularly monitored , especially for np , op , and bpa that are considered as priority hazardous compounds in the water framework directive .	0
irradiation modes ' impact on radical entrapment in photoactive resins .. different irradiation protocols are proposed to polymerize dental resins , and discordances remain concerning their impact on the material . to improve this knowledge , we studied entrapment of free radicals in unfilled bis - gma / tegdma ( 50 : 50 wt %) resin after light cure . the tested hypothesis was that various irradiation parameters ( curing time , irradiance , and radiant exposure ) and different irradiation modes ( continuous and pulse - delay ) led to different amounts of trapped free radicals . the analysis of cured samples ( n = 3 ) by electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) revealed that the concentrations of trapped free radicals significantly differed according to the curing protocol . when continuous modes with similar radiant exposure were compared , higher concentrations of trapped free radicals were measured for longer times with lower irradiance . concerning pulse modes , the delay had no influence on trapped radical concentration . these results give new insights into the understanding of the photopolymerization process and highlight the relevance of using epr when studying polymerization of dimethacrylate - based materials .	0
fracture resistance of pin - retained amalgam , composite resin , and alloy - reinforced glass ionomer core materials .. this study investigated the influence of pins on the fracture resistance of three core materials . two or four stainless steel pins were incorporated in either amalgam , composite resin , or alloy - reinforced glass ionomer specimens . half of the pins were surface - treated with mercury , panavia ex resin , or hydrochloric acid before they were incorporated in the respective materials . the pins were oriented in a direction relative to the tensile stress / axis of the specimen : parallel / perpendicular ( pl / pr ), perpendicular / parallel ( pr / pl ), or perpendicular / perpendicular ( pr / pr ). anova tested significant differences in diametral tensile strength among materials , in number of pins , in pin orientations , in surface treatments , and in other interactions . incorporation of pins weakened amalgam the most , followed by composite resin . pins did not weaken amalgam - reinforced glass ionomer . pin orientation improved the fracture resistance of some specimens by two times that of the controls . orientation of pins parallel to the tensile stress was most favorable . as the number of pins increased , the fracture resistance of amalgam significantly decreased . acid treatment of the pin surface enhanced the bond with composite resin . both treatments resulted in significant improvement in fracture resistance .	0
effects of riboflavin photosensitization on the degradation of bisphenol a ( bpa ) in model and real - food systems .. effects of riboflavin photosensitizations on the stability of bisphenol a ( bpa ), a well - known endocrine disrupting chemical , were studied in model and real - food systems by high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ). concentration of bpa was significantly decreased under light exposure ( p < 0 . 05 ) as the concentration of riboflavin increased while those without riboflavin under light or those with riboflavin in the dark did not change significantly ( p > 0 . 05 ). addition of 50 , 100 , and 200 microm sodium azide significantly increased the stability of bpa in riboflavin photosensitization with concentration dependent manner ( p < 0 . 05 ), implying that a singlet oxygen or type ii pathway played a role in the photodegradation of bpa . stability of bpa in riboflavin was significantly increased in the presence of high concentration of tert - butanol , a hydroxyl radical quencher , under light storage for 80 min , indicating hydroxyl radicals were involved and contributed to the degradation of bpa , at least in part . availability of riboflavin photosensitization on the photodegradation of bpa was tested in 2 canned tea beverages with different phenolic contents . bpa was more stable in the beverage sample with higher total phenolic contents and free radical scavenging ability . the photodegradation of bpa in riboflavin photosensitization can be an efficient way to decrease the concentration of bpa from environmental or food systems .	0
modeling the interaction of binary and ternary mixtures of estradiol with bisphenol a and bisphenol af in an in vitro estrogen - mediated transcriptional activation assay ( t47d - kbluc ).. exposure to xenoestrogens occurs against a backdrop to physiological levels of endogenous estrogens . endogenous estrogen levels vary from low levels in early childhood to high levels during pregnancy and in young women . however , few studies have addressed how xenoestrogens interact with endogenous estrogens . the current study was designed to characterize the individual dose - response curves of estradiol - 17beta ( e ( 2 )), bisphenol a ( bpa ), tetrabromo - bisphenol a ( tbbpa ), and bisphenol af ( bpaf , 4 , 4 '- hexafluoroisopropylidene diphenol ) on estrogen - dependent luciferase expression in t47d - kbluc cells and to determine how binary ( 8 x 8 factorial ) and ternary ( 4 x 4 x 4 factorial ) mixtures of an endogenous estrogen ( e ( 2 )) interact with bpa and / or bpaf . log ec ( 50 ) and hillslope values with ses , respectively , for individual compounds were as follows : e ( 2 ), - 12 . 10m +/- 0 . 06071 , 0 . 7702 +/- 0 . 1739 ; bpa , - 6 . 679m +/- 0 . 08505 , 1 . 194 +/- 0 . 2137 ; and bpaf , - 7 . 648m +/- 0 . 05527 , 1 . 273 +/- 0 . 1739 . tbbpa was not evaluated in mixture studies because of its minimally estrogenic response at 3 x10 (- 5 ) m and elicited cytotoxicity at higher concentrations . both the binary mixtures of e ( 2 ) with bpa and bpaf and the ternary mixture of e ( 2 ), bpa , and bpaf behaved in an additive manner . for binary mixtures , as e ( 2 ) concentration increased , higher concentrations of bpa and bpaf were necessary to induce a significant increase in the estrogenic response . understanding the behavior of mixture interactions of xenoestrogens , like bpa and bpaf , with endogenous estrogens will allow a better assessment of the potential risk associated with exposure to these chemicals , individually or as mixtures .	0
pre - natal exposure of mice to bisphenol a elicits an endometriosis - like phenotype in female offspring .. endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease characterized by the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity . exposure to endocrine disruptors during critical period of development causes long - lasting effects , being the genital system one of the targets . this study describes the effects on female genital system caused by developmental exposure to the endocrine - disrupting chemical bisphenol a ( bpa ) during pre - and peri - natal development in mice . to this end , timed pregnant balb - c mice were treated from day 1 of gestation to 7 days after delivery with bpa ( 100 , or 1000 microg / kg / day ). after delivery , pups were held for 3 months ; then , pelvic organs were analyzed in their entirety and livers of both pups and moms were studied for the presence of bpa . we found in the adipose tissue surrounding the genital tracts of a consistent number of treated animals , endometriosis - like structure with the presence of both glands and stroma and expressing both estrogen receptor and hoxa - 10 . moreover , cystic ovaries , adenomatous hyperplasia with cystic endometrial hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia were significantly more frequent in treated animals respect to the controls . finally , bpa was found in the livers of exposed moms and female offspring . in conclusion , we describe for the first time an endometriosis - like phenotype in mice , elicited by pre - natal exposition to bpa . this observation may induce to thoroughly reconsider the pathogenesis and treatment of endometriosis , considering the high incidence of endometriosis and the problems caused by associated infertility .	0
strengthening composite resin restorations with ceramic whisker reinforcement .. due to their tendency to fracture , current composite formulations are unsuitable for use in large stress - bearing direct posterior restorations that involve cusps . this study investigated the use of single - crystalline ceramic whiskers for the reinforcement of composite resins . the whisker - reinforced composite materials exhibited physical characteristics ( i . e ., flexural strength , work - of - fracture , and elastic modulus ) that were significantly greater ( p < 0 . 05 ; student ' s t test ) than those of traditional composite formulations . the experimental materials also had a surface smoothness that was essentially comparable to hybrid composite control specimens .	0
migration of bisphenol a from can coatings -- effects of damage , storage conditions and heating .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is an important monomer used in the manufacture of epoxy resins for internal food can linings . experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of different storage conditions and can damage on the migration of bpa to foods . these experiments were conducted in a systematic fashion by filling empty epoxyphenolic coated cans with four foods : soup , minced beef , evaporated milk and carrots and a food simulant ( 10 % ethanol ). filled cans of each food type or simulant were then sealed and processed using appropriate conditions , before storage at three different temperatures : 5 degrees c , 20 degrees c and 40 degrees c . for each of the storage regimes , 50 % of the cans were dented to establish if this would lead to increased bpa migration . cans were removed from these stocks at intervals of 1 , 3 and 9 months storage at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c or 10 days , 1 and 3 months at 40 degrees c . some initial problems of heterogeneity between samples was overcome by determining the amount of bpa in food as well as in the can lining . it was found that 80 - 100 % of the total bpa present in the coating had migrated to foods directly after can processing by pilot plant filling with food or simulant , sealing and sterilization . this level was not changed by extended storage ( up to 9 months ) or can damage , indicating most migration was occurring during the can processing step . there was no noticeable difference , in this respect , between the different foods or the food simulant . analysis of control samples ( foods fortified with approximately 0 . 1 mg kg (- 1 ) bpa and contained in schott bottles ) showed that bpa was stable under both processing and storage . experiments were also conducted to investigate the potential effects , on the migration of bpa from can coatings , of cooking or heating foods in the can prior to consumption . food cans were purchased and the food either cooked or heated in the can . bpa was analysed prior to and after the heating / cooking process . it was concluded from the results that there were no appreciable differences in the bpa level before and after cooking or heating .	0

[ new materials for intraocular lenses ].. the first intraocular lens implanted in a human eye 39 years then lenses ago , was made of polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ). today this material is considered to be the standard , so every new type of material is compared to pmma and must fulfil the requirements demanded of an intraocular implant today . therefore , every attempt is made to use pmma as the main structure while eliminating the disadvantageous characteristics even though they are minimal . thus , the hydrophobic surface can be made more biocompatible by heparin - surface modification . in recent years , hydroxyethylmethacrylate ( hema ) and silicone have achieved a certain level of clinical importance . another of the new materials is polycarbonate , which is still in the preclinical phase .	0
a multicentered clinical study on posterior resin - bonded bridges : the ' manchester trial '.. this study was designed to investigate and identify factors relevant to the success and failure of posterior resin - bonded bridges ( prbbs ) related to the patient , technique , operator and bridge design . it was a long - term controlled clinical trial and formed part of a multicentered study on prbbs . data are presented 2 . 5 years from the start of the study . following a strict protocol for case selection , 54 posterior , resin - bonded , fixed - fixed , three unit bridges were placed in 45 patients . twenty - four patients with 27 prbbs attended for 2 . 5 - year recall . treatment variables were limited to one of two operators and either a conventional tooth preparation or a more extensive modified preparation was performed . the allocation of treatment modalities was performed using a computer program to balance patient variables such as age , gender , location of bridge , restoration of abutment teeth . all bridges were produced in one laboratory , treated to produce a silicate - coating bond and placed using microfill pontic c ( kulzer , wehrheim , germany ). data relating to the patients , the open spaces , bridge preparation , bridge placement and subsequent annual evaluation were recorded . the survival of prbbs in the maxilla was 77 % and in the mandible 47 %.	0
design - of - experiment strategy for the formulation of laccase biocatalysts and their application to degrade bisphenol a .. immobilizing enzymes can expand their applicability to continuous process operations and facilitates process intensification . an optimized formulation of immobilized biocatalysts is therefore of strategic interest in the field of industrial biotechnology . nevertheless , biocatalyst formulation still largely relies on empirical approaches which lack effectiveness in the identification of optimum immobilization conditions . in the present study , design of experiments , multiple linear regressions and modeling were used to screen , interpret and finally optimize crucial immobilization parameters . a laccase preparation from coriolopsis polyzona mucl38443 was immobilized via a sequential adsorption - crosslinking process on mesoporous silica particles . as a target variable , biocatalyst activity was doubled (∼ 280 u g (- 1 )) while dramatically reducing processing time ( two hours instead of 26 hours ) and reagent inputs ( 80 mm instead of 1m glutaraldehyde ( glu )). immobilization yield (∼ 50 %) and thermostability (∼ 60 % residual activity after 24 hours at 45 ° c ) could be maintained under the optimized conditions . as an example of its application in environmental biotechnology , the optimized biocatalyst was implemented in a continuous stirred - tank membrane reactor ( cstmr ) to continuously degrade the endocrine disruptor bisphenol a ( bpa ) in wastewater . a 90 % removal of 50 μm bpa was achieved over 30 reactor volumes ( hydraulic residence time ( hrt ) of 1 . 85 hours , 50 ml working volume ).	0

marginal adaptation of a restorative resin polymerized at reduced rate .. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of reduced rate of polymerization on the marginal adaptation of a composite resin inserted in dentin cavities treated with a simplified gluma system . the effect on bonding strength to dentin and compressive strength was also investigated . the light intensity of the polymerization unit was lowered by the use of a transformer , and thus the rate of polymerization of the composite resin . when the resin was irradiated for 30 s at 110 v followed by 30 s at 220 v , the marginal adaptation was significantly improved . this condition resulted in acceptable values of bonding strength to dentin and diametral compressive strength . it is suggested that the reduced rate of polymerization may allow for increased flow of the material , decreasing the contraction stress in the filling .	0
quantitative analysis of adhesive resin in the hybrid layer using raman spectroscopy .. the objective was to determine absolute molar concentration of adhesive resin components in the hybrid layer by establishing methods based on raman spectroscopy fundamentals . the hybrid layer was treated as a three - component system consisting of collagen and an adhesive resin containing two monomers . adhesive standard specimens and raman peak area ratios obtained with a 785 nm excitation wavelength were used to construct separate calibration curves for comonomer relative molar concentration and bis - gma absolute molar concentration . as collagen and water had no measurable peaks in the fingerprint region , a dilution coefficient k ( j ) was defined to describe their impact on raman peak area and to calculate hema absolute molar concentration . methodology was validated using an analogous system containing acetone / ethanol / water . the absolute molar concentration of bis - gma and hema decreased 87 % and 83 %, respectively , from the top quarter to the middle of the hybrid layer . additionally , less bis - gma penetrated the hybrid layer than hema , as indicated by the approximately 20 % decrease in comonomer molar concentration ratio between the adhesive resin layer and the top half of the hybrid layer . lack of complete monomer infiltration will further challenge dentin - adhesive bond longevity .

[ visible light cured resin . change of quantity of remaining double bonds in the surface low conversion layer by ft - ir method ].. the quantity of the remaining double bonds ( rdb ) in polymerized visible light cured resins has been determined . five trial unfilled resins , eight commercial composite resins and three commercial crown and bridge resins were investigated by fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer with the liquid - film method . infrared absorbance was measured before irradiation and at various times after irradiation . the quantity of rdb was determined and the data expressed as percentage of the total amount of double bonds in the unpolymerized resins . the quantity of rdb of five trial unfilled resins decreased linearly corresponding to the logarithmic time after the start of irradiation . the difference in the quantity of rdb at 5 min and decreasing rate of rdb could be seen in accordance with the kind of monomer . among five trial unfilled resins , one with bmpepp ( bpe - 200 ) used as monomer gave the smallest rdb , and one with 4 pn -( tf ) 2 -( ema ) 6 used as monomer gave the largest value . the quantity of rdb in the unfilled resin with tri - edma at 5 min decreased in accordance with the irradiation time , but after 1 month , it showed almost the same value irrespective of the irradiation time . the quantity of rdb of commercial composite resins and crown and bridge resins decreased linearly corresponding to logarithmic time . in all commercial resins , the quantity of rdb became small when the base monomer was bis - gma but large when it was udma .	0
is bisphenol - a exposure during pregnancy associated with blood glucose levels or diagnosis of gestational diabetes ?. recent epidemiological studies indicate bisphenol a ( bpa ), an estrogenic chemical used in production of epoxy , polycarbonate , and plastic may increase risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes . exposure to bpa during pregnancy may contribute to development of gestational diabetes mellitus ( gdm ), a precursor to type 2 diabetes in women . this pilot study examined the association between bpa exposure , fasting blood glucose levels ( fbg ), and gdm diagnosis during pregnancy . banked urine samples from 22 cases of gdm and 72 controls were analyzed for total ( free bpa + conjugates ) urinary bpa concentrations ( μg / l ). fbg levels ( mg / dl ) were obtained from 1 - h 50 - g glucose tolerance tests ( gtt ) that women underwent for routine gdm screening ( mean gestational age = 26 . 6 weeks , sd = 3 . 8 ). those with an initial screening value ≥ 135 mg / dl underwent 3 - h 100 g oral gtt . gdm diagnoses were made when the initial screening value was ≥ 200 mg / dl or when values at ≥ 2 time points exceeded 3 - h oral gtt thresholds . among controls , median fbg levels ( mg / dl ) did not differ across exposure tertiles , defined according to the distribution of total specific - gravity - adjusted urinary bpa concentrations . logistic regression models controlling for race / ethnicity did not provide evidence of association between bpa exposure and case status across increasing tertiles of bpa exposure ( number of gdm cases / controls in tertile1 : 13 / 24 ; in tertile 2 : 6 / 24 ; in tertile 3 : 3 / 24 ). findings do not support a relationship between total urinary bpa concentrations and altered glucose metabolism during pregnancy . however , due to study limitations , findings need to be interpreted with caution .	0

[ durability of commercial composite resin . chronological change in transverse strength and transverse elastic modulus of composite resin immersed in meoh ].. the durability of visible light - cured composite resin was examined . five kinds of commercial redox type composite resin and 7 kinds of visible light - cured composite resin were used and their base monomers were analyzed by hplc . after the set products were immersed in meoh , transverse strength and transverse elastic modulus were measured . furthermore , the meoh sorption , solubility in meoh and main soluble component were examined . the main component of the base monomer in all 5 kinds of redox type was bis - gma . seven kinds of visible light - cured composite resin consisted of 4 kinds of bis - gma ( including bmpepp ) and 3 kinds of udma . both cases of redox type and visible light - cured type of composite resin , when they were immersed in meoh , transverse strength and transverse elastic modulus decreased . in the case of redox type ( clearfil posterior new bond ), the decrease of transverse strength and transverse elastic modulus was small , that is , its base monomer was bis - gma , and large quantities of hybrid type filler were mixed . in the case of redox type , transverse strength and transverse elastic modulus showed a tendency to decrease with the increase of meoh sorption . solubility of 12 kinds of these composite resins was 0 . 25 - 4 . 78 % and its main component in pyrofil light bond a was bmpepp , the residual were coincident with the main component of base monomer .	0
a clinical trial of four light - curing posterior composite resins : two - year report .. a 2 - year study of the clinical performance of four posterior composite resins used for class i and class ii restorations is reported . seventy - seven obturations were reviewed from the patients selected for a previous 9 - month study . obturations were assessed macrophotographically and by scanning electron microscopic evaluation of marginal quality . the 2 - year results were compared to those obtained at 9 months . the macrophotographic evaluation revealed a satisfactory clinical appearance in the majority of restorations . however , scanning electron micrographic observations demonstrated that moderate - to - medium marginal degradation occurred during the first 2 years of clinical service . therefore the use of the products under investigation should be limited to selected cases in which esthetics is of primary concern .	0
preventive resin restorations vs . amalgam restorations : a three - year clinical study .. a three - year clinical study was completed at the college of dentistry comparing the overall performance of class i amalgam restorations with preventive resin restorations ( prrs ). seventy - four prrs and fifty - two amalgam restorations were placed in the posterior teeth of thirty - eight patients . the prr was composed of two materials : p - 50 ( 3m corp .), a heavily filled composite resin , and white sealant ( 3m corp .), a light - cured sealant . fast - set dispersalloy ( johnson and johnson corp .) was used for the amalgam restorations . the restorations were evaluated at six months , one year , two years and three years . the usphs / ryge system was used to evaluate anatomic form , marginal adaptation , marginal discoloration and recurrent caries of both type restorations . a restoration was considered a failure if any part of the restoration was replaced due to secondary caries . there were two failures of prrs at six months , and four failures at one year . failures were due to non retention of the sealant of the prr and possibly related to operator error . the failures were easily repaired and removed from the study . no prr failed at the two or three year evaluations . no amalgam restoration failed within the three year period .	0
flow injection fluorimetric determination of beta - estradiol using a molecularly imprinted polymer .. the steroidal compound 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) is a major estrogen now widely studied because of its potential endocrine disruption effects . the present paper describes a simple , rapid , flow injection ( fi ) method for the fluorimetric determination of beta - estradiol involving a molecularly imprinted polymer ( mip ) packed into a microcolumn . microwave - assisted extraction , a relatively new technique , was used to help remove the template from the mip ; this improved extraction efficiency . the optimization of the fi parameters and the intrinsic fluorescence of beta - estradiol allowed its direct determination without a derivatization step . when the possible interference of other estrogens was examined , the system displayed excellent specificity for beta - estradiol ; no response to the natural estrogens estrone and estriol and the xenoestrogen bisphenol a was recorded . under optimum experimental conditions , linear calibration graphs were obtained from 4 to 80 microg l (- 1 ) with a detection limit of 1 . 12 microg l (- 1 ).	0
prenatal and lactational exposure to bisphenol a in mice alters expression of genes involved in cortical barrel development without morphological changes .. it has been reported that premature infants in neonatal intensive care units are exposed to a high rate of bisphenol a ( bpa ), an endocrine disrupting chemical . our previous studies demonstrated that corticothalamic projection was disrupted by prenatal exposure to bpa , which persisted even in adult mice . we therefore analyzed whether prenatal and lactational exposure to low doses of bpa affected the formation of the cortical barrel , the barreloid of the thalamus , and the barrelette of the brainstem in terms of the histology and the expression of genes involved in the barrel development . pregnant mice were injected subcutaneously with 20 µg / kg of bpa daily from embryonic day 0 ( e0 ) to postnatal 3 weeks ( p3w ), while the control mice received a vehicle alone . the barrel , barreloid and barrelette of the adult mice were examined by cytochrome c oxidase ( cox ) staining . there were no significant differences in the total and septal areas and the patterning of the posterior medial barrel subfield ( pmbsf ), barreloid and barrelette , between the bpa - exposure and control groups in the adult mice . the developmental study at postnatal day 1 ( pd1 ), pd4 and pd8 revealed that the cortical barrel vaguely appeared at pd4 and completely formed at pd8 in both groups . the expression pattern of some genes was spatiotemporally altered depending on the sex and the treatment . these results suggest that the trigeminal projection and the thalamic relay to the cortical barrel were spared after prenatal and lactational exposure to low doses of bpa , although prenatal exposure to bpa was previously shown to disrupt the corticothalamic projection .	0
correlation of filler content and elastic properties of resin - composites .. objectives : the aim was to determine the young ' s modulus ( e ), bulk modulus ( b ), shear modulus ( g ) and poisson ' s ratio ( nu ) of a series of composite restorative materials and to correlate them with their filler volume - fractions . methods : twelve model resin - composite formulations , with systematically varied volume - fraction ( tokuyama ), a flowable resin - composite ( point 4 flowable , kerr ) and two hybrid resin - composites ( filtek supreme xt , 3m - espe & x - tra fil , voco ) were investigated . twelve cylindrical specimens ( 5 mm x 6 mm ) were prepared from each material . six were free to expand radially under axial compressive loading , and were used to calculate the young ' s modulus ( e ). the other six were radially constricted in a rigid stainless steel ring during loading , from which the bulk modulus ( b ) was calculated . compression loading was performed at 1mm / min . the young ' s and bulk moduli were determined using equations of elasticity . poisson ' s ratio from nu = 0 . 5 -( e / 6b ) and shear modulus from g = e / 2 ( 1 + nu ). results : young ' s moduli ranged from 2 . 19 to 7 . 15gpa , bulk moduli from 12 . 79 to 22 . 43gpa and shear moduli from 0 . 74 to 2 . 47gpa . poisson ' s ratio ranged from 0 . 45 for the stiffer to 0 . 47 for the more compliant composites . statistically significant differences ( anova and bonferroni at p = 0 . 05 ) were found depending on filler volume - fraction . significance : elastic moduli varied significantly and a positive correlation existed between elastic moduli and filler volume - fraction ( r2 : 0 . 905 - 0 . 992 and 0 . 940 - 1 . 000 for young ' s and bulk moduli , respectively ).	0
"""ovarian intrafollicular processes as a target for cigarette smoke components and selected environmental reproductive disruptors .. steroidogenesis , expansion of oocyte - cumulus complex , and meiotic maturation of the oocyte represent intrafollicular processes taking important part in the background of successful fertilisation . the reproductive health of female could be affected by a number of endogenous as well as exogenous factors , such as exposure to agents from specific lifestyle habits , environmental pollutants with endocrine disrupting properties , or heavy metals . published data indicate that exposure to chemicals may cause alterations in reproductive behavior and contribute to sub - fecundity , infertility , or ovarian failure . female reproductive functions can be compromised by exposure to toxic chemicals at a variety of sites , including ovary or reproductive tract . substantial harmful effects of cigarette smoke on fecundity and reproduction have become apparent but are not generally appreciated . the effects of cigarette smoke components ( cadmium , nicotine , cotinine ) absorbed into the organism on intrafollicular processes may thus in part explain the negative impact of smoking on female fertility . moreover , it is now evident that a variety of man - made pollutants present in the environment are capable to disrupt normal endocrine function in many species . examples of these """" endocrine disrupters """" include plasticizers , such as phthalates and bisphenol a . the effects of selected environmental chemicals on the processes of steroidogenesis , expansion of oocyte - cumulus complex , and meiotic maturation of the oocyte are summarized in the present paper and possible mechanisms of action of these agents are suggested . however , for complete understanding the mechanisms by which chemical agents from the environment can affect the intrafollicular processes , a lot of further investigation is needed ."""	0

endocrine disruptors in utero cause ovarian damages linked to endometriosis .. timed pregnant balb - c mice were treated from day 1 of gestation to 7 days after delivery with the endocrine disruptor bisphenol a ( bpa ) ( 100 , or 1 , 000 microg / kg / day ). after delivery , pups were hold for three months ; then , ovaries were analyzed in their entirety . we found that in the ovaries of bpa - treated animals the number of primordial follicles and of developing follicles was significantly lower than in the untreated animals . moreover , the number of atretic follicles was significantly higher in the treated animals . finally , we found that the animals displaying endometriosis - like phenotype had a more severe impairment of the ovaries in term of number of primordial and developing follicles in comparison with the other mice exposed to bpa . in conclusion , we describe for the first time a complex phenotype in mice , elicited by pre - natal exposition to bpa , that includes ovarian lesions and endometriosis . considering the high incidence of endometriosis and of the premature ovarian failure associated to infertility in these patients , the data showed prompt a thoroughly reconsideration of the pathological framing of these lesions .	0
thermal variations in the pulp chamber associated with composite insertion techniques and light - curing methods .. aim : the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different incremental insertion techniques , photoactivation , and restorative phases on thermal variations occurring during the polymerization of filtek z250 composite resin . methods and materials : the experiment was conducted using 90 bovine incisor teeth . the teeth were randomly assigned to three groups according to the technique used for photoactivation with a halogen light ( continuous , soft - start , or intermittent ). the groups were further separated into three subgroups according to method of increment placement ( bulk , oblique , or horizontal / vertical ) for a total of nine groups ( n = 10 ). restorations were placed in a controlled environment ( 37 masculinec and 50 +/- 10 % ru ) and the temperature recorded using a digital thermometer coupled to a type - k thermocouple inserted in the pulp chamber through the root canal in contact with the dentin . data were analyzed using an analysis of variance ( anova ) and the tukey ' s test . results : higher temperature values were found for continuous light photoactivation in combination with the placement of horizontal / vertical composite increments and photoactivation of the adhesive using a continuous light exposure . conclusion : the light source is the most important factor producing temperature changes during photoactivation of resin composite . clinical significance : temperature increases in the pulp chamber due to light curing should be considered to avoid harming the delicate pulp tissue when large restorations or inlays / onlays require several consecutive light curing exposures for a complete cure .	0
postnatal exposure to low - dose bisphenol a influences various emotional conditions .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is one of the ' environmental endocrine disrupters ' ( eeds ) released by plastics and resin known to interfere with hormonal responses . in this study , female wistar rats were exposed to low - dose bpa ( 24 μg / kg / day ) during 7 days after giving birth . the male and female offspring , exposed to the bpa through lactation , were evaluated using an open field test ( oft ) at the age of six weeks , an elevated plus maze test ( epm ) at seven weeks , and a forced swimming test ( fst ) at nine weeks . the oft indicated that females were more active than males , and that bpa selectively increased rearing duration in males , thereby eliminating the gender effect . the results of epm showed that bpa did not enhance the anxiety - like action ; rather , it was associated with an anxiolytic - like action in females . in the fst , not only there was an increase in the immobility time , but also there was reduction of latency observed in bpa rats . it indicated that the depression - like responses were clearly enhanced by the postnatal exposure . altogether , these data suggest that low - dose bpa ingested by neonates through breastfeeding may cause persistent aberrant behaviors that are relevant to emotions .	0
bisphenol a impairs follicle growth , inhibits steroidogenesis , and downregulates rate - limiting enzymes in the estradiol biosynthesis pathway .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is used as the backbone for plastics and epoxy resins , including various food and beverage containers . bpa has also been detected in 95 % of random urine samples and ovarian follicular fluid of adult women . few studies have investigated the effects of bpa on antral follicles , the main producers of sex steroid hormones and the only follicles capable of ovulation . thus , this study tested the hypothesis that postnatal bpa exposure inhibits antral follicle growth and steroidogenesis . to test this hypothesis , antral follicles isolated from 32 - day - old fvb mice were cultured with vehicle control ( dimethyl sulfoxide [ dmso ]), bpa ( 4 . 4 - 440 μm ), pregnenolone ( 10 μg / ml ), pregnenolone + bpa 44 μm , and pregnenolone + bpa 440 μm . during the culture , follicles were measured for growth daily . after the culture , media was subjected to elisa for hormones in the estradiol biosynthesis pathway , and follicles were processed for quantitative real - time pcr of steroidogenic enzymes . the results indicate that bpa ( 440 μm ) inhibits follicle growth and that pregnenolone cotreatment was unable to restore / maintain growth . furthermore , bpa 44 and 440 μm inhibit progesterone , dehydroepiandrosterone , androstenedione , estrone , testosterone , and estradiol production . pregnenolone cotreatment was able to increase production of pregnenolone , progesterone , and dehydroepiandrosterone and maintain androstenedione and estrone levels in bpa - treated follicles compared with dmso controls but was unable to protect testosterone or estradiol levels . furthermore , pregnenolone was unable to protect follicles from bpa -( 44 - 440 μm ) induced inhibition of steroidogenic enzymes compared with the dmso control . collectively , these data show that bpa targets the estradiol biosynthesis pathway in the ovary .	0
bisphenol - a rapidly promotes dynamic changes in hippocampal dendritic morphology through estrogen receptor - mediated pathway by concomitant phosphorylation of nmda receptor subunit nr2b .. bisphenol - a ( bpa ) is known to be a potent endocrine disrupter . evidence is emerging that estrogen exerts a rapid influence on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the dendritic spine density , which requires activation of nmda receptors . in the present study , we investigated the effects of bpa ( ranging from 1 to 1000 nm ), focusing on the rapid dynamic changes in dendritic filopodia and the expressions of estrogen receptor ( er ) β and nmda receptor , as well as the phosphorylation of nmda receptor subunit nr2b in the cultured hippocampal neurons . a specific er antagonist ici 182 , 780 was used to examine the potential involvement of ers . the results demonstrated that exposure to bpa ( ranging from 10 to 1000 nm ) for 30 min rapidly enhanced the motility and the density of dendritic filopodia in the cultured hippocampal neurons , as well as the phosphorylation of nr2b ( pnr2b ), though the expressions of nmda receptor subunits nr1 , nr2b , and erβ were not changed . the antagonist of ers completely inhibited the bpa - induced increases in the filopodial motility and the number of filopodia extending from dendrites . the increased pnr2b induced by bpa ( 100 nm ) was also completely eliminated . furthermore , bpa attenuated the effects of 17β - estradiol ( 17β - e₂ ) on the dendritic filopodia outgrowth and the expression of pnr2b when bpa was co - treated with 17β - e₂ . the present results suggest that bpa , like 17β - e₂ , rapidly results in the enhanced motility and density of dendritic filopodia in the cultured hippocampal neurons with the concomitant activation of nmda receptor subunit nr2b via an er - mediated signaling pathway . meanwhile , bpa suppressed the enhancement effects of 17β - e₂ when it coexists with 17β - e₂ . these results provided important evidence suggesting the neurotoxicity of the low levels of bpa during the early postnatal development of the brain .	0
preferential solvation of poly ( methyl methacrylate ) and a bisphenol a diglycidyl ether by size - exclusion chromatography .. the preferential adsorption coefficient , lambda , of poly ( methyl methacrylate ), pmma , in solutions formed by an epoxy resin in tetrahydrofuran ( thf ), was studied by size - exclusion chromatography ( sec ). only pmma of lowest molar mass was preferentially solvated by epoxy but at low concentrations of epoxy in the mixture . at higher epoxy content pmma was preferentially solvated by thf . a simultaneous and competitive solvation between the specific interactions pmma - epoxy and the self association of epoxy at high concentrations would be the responsible of this inversion point . the more compacted coil of pmma of higher molecular weights in solution could explain the lack of interaction of these polymers with epoxy . the results also indicated that lambda decreased with the molar mass . this variation has been attributed to the influence of the coil segment density on preferential adsorption .	0
construction of a bacterial assay for estrogen detection based on an estrogen - sensitive intein .. escherichia coli strain dier was constructed for estrogen detection by inserting an estrogen - sensitive intein ( vma ( er ) intein ) into the specific site of the constitutively expressed chromosomal lacz gene . this vma ( er ) intein was generated by replacing the endonuclease region of the saccharomyces cerevisiae vma intein with the estrogen binding region of the human estrogen receptor α ( herα ). when there were estrogens or analogs , the splicing of the vma ( er ) intein was induced to produce the mature lacz protein , which was detected through a β - galactosidase colorimetric assay . eight typical chemicals ( 17 - β - estradiol , bisphenol a , chrysene , 6 - oh - chrysene , benz [ a ] anthracene , pyrene , progesterone , and testosterone ) were detected using this dier strain , and the whole detection procedure was accomplished in 2 h . their 50 % effective concentrations ( ec ( 50 )), relative estrogenic activities , and estradiol equivalency factors were calculated and were quite consistent with those detected with the yeast estrogen screening ( yes ) system . furthermore , the estrogenic activities of the synthetic musk samples extracted from the wastewater and waste sludge of a sewage treatment plant of shanghai ( china ) were detected , and their results were comparable to those obtained from the yes system and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ). in conclusion , the dier bioassay could fill a niche for the efficient , rapid , high - throughput screening of estrogenic compounds and has potential for the remote , near - real - time monitoring of environmental estrogens .	0
solar regeneration of powdered activated carbon impregnated with visible - light responsive photocatalyst : factors affecting performances and predictive model .. this study demonstrated a green technique to regenerate spent powdered activated carbon ( ac ) using solar photocatalysis . the ac was impregnated with a photocatalyst photoexcitable under visible - light irradiation to yield a solar regenerable composite , namely nitrogen - doped titanium dioxide ( n - tio ( 2 )/ ac ). this composite exhibited bifunctional adsorptive - photocatalytic characteristics . contaminants of emerging environmental concern , i . e . bisphenol - a ( bpa ), sulfamethazine ( smz ) and clofibric acid ( cfa ) which exhibited varying affinities for ac were chosen as target pollutants . the adsorption of bpa and smz by the n - tio ( 2 )/ ac was significantly higher than that of cfa . the performance of solar photocatalytic regeneration ( spr ) of the spent n - tio ( 2 )/ ac composite generally increased with light intensity , n - tio ( 2 ) loading and temperature . the regeneration efficiency ( re ) for cfa - loaded spent composite was the highest compared to the other pollutant - loaded spent composites , achieving 77 % within 8h of solar irradiation ( 765 w m (- 2 )). the rate - limiting process was pollutant desorption from the interior ac sorption sites . a kinetic model was developed to predict the transient concentration of the sorbate remaining in the spent composite during spr . comparison studies using solvent extraction technique indicated a different order of re for the three pollutants , attributable to their varying solubilities in the aqueous and organic solvents .	0
the effect of curing light and chemical catalyst on the degree of conversion of two dual cured resin luting cements .. the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different curing lights and chemical catalysts on the degree of conversion of resin luting cements . a total of 60 disk - shaped specimens of relyx arc or panavia f of diameter 5 mm and thickness 0 . 5 mm were prepared and the respective chemical catalyst ( scotchbond multi - purpose plus or ed primer ) was added . the specimens were light - cured using different curing units ( an argon ion laser , an led or a quartz - tungsten - halogen light ) through shade a2 composite disks of diameter 10 mm and thickness 2 mm . after 24 h of dry storage at 37 ° c , the degree of conversion of the resin luting cements was measured by fourier - transformed infrared spectroscopy . for statistical analysis , anova and the tukey test were used , with p ≤ 0 . 05 . panavia f when used without catalyst and cured using the led or the argon ion laser showed degree of conversion values significantly lower than relyx arc , with and without catalyst , and cured with any of the light sources . therefore , the degree of conversion of panavia f with ed primer cured with the quartz - tungsten - halogen light was significantly different from that of relyx arc regardless of the use of the chemical catalyst and light curing source . in conclusion , relyx arc can be cured satisfactorily with the argon ion laser , led or quartz - tungsten - halogen light with or without a chemical catalyst . to obtain a satisfactory degree of conversion , panavia f luting cement should be used with ed primer and cured with halogen light .	0
effect of bisphenol a , tetrachlorobisphenol a and pentachlorophenol on the transcriptional activities of androgen receptor - mediated reporter gene .. previously , we developed an androgen receptor ( ar )- mediated reporter gene assay system , and verified the antiandrogenic activity of bisphenol a ( bpa ) based on this assay . there were some similar phenol - ring structure chemicals which were widely used while little had been done to evaluate their effect to androgen . in the present study , we applied this assay to evaluate the androgenic and antiandrogenic activities of some phenolic chemicals including bpa , tetrachlorobisphenol a ( tcbpa ), and pentachlorophenol ( pcp ). the results showed that bpa exhibited potent antiandrogenic activity with ic50 value of 2 . 14 microm . tcbpa showed relative weaker activity with ic50 value of 10 . 45 microm and pcp did not show ar antagonistic activity . on the other hand , we failed to find ar agonistic effects of the three chemicals . to study the reason why bpa and tcbpa reduced the reporter gene expression , we increased the dht concentration to 100 nm and 10 microm in the reporter assay . then , we found that the antagonist activity of bpa and tcbpa decreased with the increase of concentration of dht . this result indicated that these two test chemicals could compete with dht for the binding of ar . when comparing the structure difference between bpa , tcbpa and pcp , we got a preliminary founding that 3 , 5 - substituents of phenol ring of bpa decrease its antiandrogenic activity . these results provide some useful information for the assessment of the antiandrogenic activity of bpa like chemicals and the potential mechanism .	0
occupational dermatoses from epoxy resin compounds .. this study comprises 40 patients with skin disorders from current or previous occupational exposure to epoxy resin compounds ( erc ) during 1984 - 1988 . ercs were the 3rd most common cause ( 32 of 264 cases : 12 . 1 %) of currently relevant allergic contact dermatitis : 23 cases from epoxy resins based on the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol a ( dgeba - ers ), 5 from reactive diluents , 1 from amine hardeners ( deta ), and 3 from epoxy acrylates . 2 cases ( 0 . 8 %) of irritant contact dermatitis were due to ercs . methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride ( mhhpa , an epoxy hardener ) caused 1 case of contact urticaria . previously relevant occupational allergic contact dermatitis from dgeba - ers was detected in 5 cases . on patch testing , erc allergens gave the following positive reactions : epoxy resin of the standard series in 35 cases ( 4 . 0 % of 870 tested ), epoxy reactive diluents in 10 ( 7 . 1 % of 140 ), cycloaliphatic epoxy resins in 4 ( 11 . 1 % of 36 ), epoxy acrylates in 4 ( 4 . 5 % of 88 ), and amine compounds commonly used as epoxy hardeners in 17 . despite extensive patch test series , testing with patients ' own ercs remains important .	0
detection of estrogenic activity in sediment - associated compounds using in vitro reporter gene assays .. sediments may be the ultimate sink for persistent ( xeno -) estrogenic compounds released into the aquatic environment . sediment - associated estrogenic potency was measured with an estrogen receptor - mediated luciferase reporter gene ( er - calux ) assay and compared with a recombinant yeast screen . the er - calux assay was more sensitive to 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) than the recombinant yeast screen , with an ec50 of 6 pm e2 compared to 100 pm in the yeast screen . yeast cells were unable to distinguish the anti - estrogens ici 182 , 780 and ( 4 - hydroxy ) tamoxifen , which were agonistic in the yeast . acetone - soluble fractions of hexane / acetone extracts of sediments showed higher estrogenic potency than hexane - soluble extracts in the er - calux assay . sediments obtained from industrialized areas such as the port of rotterdam showed the highest estrogenic potency of the 12 marine sediments tested ( up to 40 pmol estradiol equivalents per gram sediment ). the estrogenic activity of individual chemicals that can be found in sediments including : alkylphenol ethoxylates and carboxylates ; phthalates ; and pesticides , was tested . increasing sidechain length of various nonylphenol ethoxylates resulted in decreased estrogenic activity . of the phthalates tested , butylbenzylphthalate was the most estrogenic , though with a potency approximately 100 , 000 times less than e2 . the organochlorine herbicides atrazine and simazine failed to induce reporter gene activity . as metabolic activation may be required to induce estrogenic activity , a metabolic transformation step was added to the er - calux assay using incubation of compounds with liver microsomes obtained from pcb - treated rats . results indicate that metabolites of e2 , np and bisphenol a were less active than the parent compounds , while metabolites of methoxychlor were more estrogenic following microsomal incubations .	0
a comparative study of fluoride - releasing composite resin and glass ionomer materials used as fissure sealants .. objectives : the objectives of the study were to investigate the clinical use of two fluoride - releasing fissure sealants and to study fluoride release under laboratory conditions . methods : in the clinical part of the study the two materials , fluroshield and baseline , were applied to matched contralateral caries - free first permanent molars in 86 children aged 7 - 8 years . in the laboratory study fluoride release from each material was measured using a model cavity system . results : after 3 years fluroshield was intact on 70 % of teeth . retention was significantly better on lower molars than upper molars . baseline was lost from all except two teeth within 6 months . after 3 years , caries had affected four teeth sealed with fluroshield and 24 teeth sealed with baseline ; this difference was highly significant . the laboratory study showed that fluroshield released twice as much fluoride over 9 days than did baseline . long term studies using fluroshield showed a small steady fluoride release over 6 months . conclusions : the conclusion of the study was that fluroshield was a much more effective fissure sealant than baseline . the clinical performance of fluroshield was comparable to that of other inert composite resin sealants and superior to that of fluoride - releasing sealants used previously .	0
composite resin compatibility and bond longevity of a dentin bonding agent .. the shear strength of a commercial dentin bonding agent was studied using human dentin in vitro . the agent was tested for compatibility with three proprietary composite resins . in addition , some samples were subjected to prolonged water immersion and thermocycling to determine effects on bond strength . there was no statistically significant difference in shear strengths when the three composite resins were used . in addition , there was no difference in shear strengths among those samples thermocycled or immersed for up to one year . the implications of this study are that the dentin bonding agent may be used with several composite resins with no significant difference in bond strengths , and that the bond seems stable when subjected to immersion or simulated intra - oral thermal stresses .	0

incisal angle adhesive resins : a 5 - year clinical survey of two materials .. two hundred and seventy - eight restoration examinations were made of concise and nuva - fil resins used to restore fractured incisors , over periods of up to 5 years . following the placement of wide bevels along the fracture margins , retention was achieved by using acid - etching with bonding resins and by pins in some instances . although the short - term results were usually reasonable , provided that the materials had been placed and finished correctly , longer - term findings revealed problems of resin darkening and corrosion staining of dentine from exposed pins . the nuva - fil restorations were generally superior to the concise restorations .	0
transfer of bisphenol a across the human placenta .. objective : the objective of the investigation was to study placental transfer and conjugation of bisphenol a ( bpa ) across the human placenta . study design : human placentae obtained from healthy term singleton pregnancies were utilized in a dual recirculating model of ex vivo placental perfusion . seven placentae were perfused with bpa ( 10 ng / ml ) added to the maternal perfusate for 180 minutes . antipyrine and fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran were used as positive and negative controls , respectively , to validate integrity of the circuits . concentrations of bpa and its conjugates were determined by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry . results : the transfer percentage for antipyrine and bpa were 25 . 5 +/- 1 . 13 % and 27 . 0 +/- 1 . 88 %, respectively , and the transfer index for bpa was 1 . 1 +/- 0 . 09 after 180 minutes of perfusion . only 3 . 2 +/- 1 . 6 % of bpa in the fetal compartment was in the conjugated form . conclusion : bisphenol a at low environmentally relevant levels can transfer across the human placenta , mainly in active unconjugated form .	0
determination of bisphenol - a levels in human amniotic fluid samples by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is one of the environmental endocrine - disrupting chemicals used widely in common consumer products . there is an increasing concern about human exposure to bpa , particularly in fetuses , due to the potential adverse effects related to the estrogenic activity of bpa . in assessing environmental exposure to bpa , it is essential to have a sensitive , accurate , and specific analytical method , particularly for low bpa levels in complex sample matrices . in this study , we developed and validated an accurate , sensitive , and robust liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ( lc - ms ) method for determining the bpa concentrations in human amniotic fluid ( af ). in this method , bpa and the internal standards ( 13 ) c ( 12 ) - bpa were extracted from 500 μl of human af using solid - phase extraction . calibration curves were linear over a concentration range of 0 . 3 - 100 ng / ml for bpa . the analytes were quantitatively determined using lc - ms operated in a negative electrospray ionization selected ion monitoring mode . this validated method has been used successfully in the clinical sample analysis of bpa in second - trimester af specimens .	0

increase in the levels of chaperone proteins by exposure to beta - estradiol , bisphenol a and 4 - methoxyphenol in human cells transfected with estrogen receptor alpha cdna .. we examined changes in the levels of chaperone proteins to evaluate the toxic effects of environmental chemicals in human cells in vitro . some chaperones are up - regulated by estrogenic chemicals , but the effect is not necessarily dependent on the receptor . thus we also investigated whether a chemical - induced change in chaperone protein expression is human estrogen receptor ( her )- dependent or not , using cultured human cell lines transfected with heralpha cdna or an empty vector . in the heralpha - expressed cells , the protein levels of the heat shock protein 27 ( hsp27 ), the glucose - regulated protein 78 ( grp78 / bip ), and grp94 increased after exposure to beta - estradiol ( e ( 2 )) ( from 10 (- 9 ) m to 10 (- 6 ) m ) and bisphenol a ( bpa ) ( from 10 (- 6 ) m to 10 (- 5 ) m ). on the other hand , the increase was not observed in the cells without heralpha expression . these results suggest that the e ( 2 )- and bpa - induced increase in the protein levels were heralpha dependent . we next examined the effect of four phenolic chemicals similar in structure to bpa , and found that among them , 4 - methoxyphenol ( from 10 (- 6 ) m to 10 (- 5 ) m ) increased the levels of the chaperone proteins with heralpha dependency . thus the human cultured cells would be suitable for evaluating whether an increase in chaperone proteins occurs upon exposure to environmental chemicals and whether the effect is er - dependent .	0
effect of temporary cements on the shear bond strength of luting cements .. objective : the purpose of this study was to evaluate , by shear bond strength ( sbs ) testing , the influence of different types of temporary cements on the final cementation using conventional and self - etching resin - based luting cements . material and methods : forty human teeth divided in two halves were assigned to 8 groups ( n = 10 ): i and v ( no temporary cementation ); ii and vi : ca ( oh ) 2 - based cement ; iii and vii : zinc oxide ( zo )- based cement ; iv and viii : zo - eugenol ( zoe )- based cement . final cementation was done with relyx arc cement ( groups i to iv ) and relyx unicem cement ( groups v to viii ). data were analyzed statistically by anova and tukey ' s test at 5 % significance level . results : means were ( mpa ): i - 3 . 80 (+/- 1 . 481 ); ii - 5 . 24 (+/- 2 . 297 ); iii - 6 . 98 (+/- 1 . 885 ); iv - 6 . 54 (+/- 1 . 459 ); v - 5 . 22 (+/- 2 . 465 ); vi - 4 . 48 (+/- 1 . 705 ); vii - 6 . 29 (+/- 2 . 280 ); viii - 2 . 47 (+/- 2 . 076 ). comparison of the groups that had the same temporary cementation ( groups ii and vi ; iii and vii ; iv and viii ) showed statistically significant difference ( p < 0 . 001 ) only between groups iv and viii , in which zoe - based cements were used . the use of either ca ( oh ) 2 - based ( groups ii and vi ) or zo - based ( groups iii and vii ) cements showed no statistically significant difference ( p > 0 . 05 ) for the different luting cements ( relyx arc and relyx unicem ). the groups that had no temporary cementation ( groups i and v ) did not differ significantly from each other either ( p > 0 . 05 ). conclusion : when temporary cementation was done with zo - or zoe - based cements and final cementation was done with relyx arc , there was an increase in the sbs compared to the control . in the groups cemented with relyx unicem , however , the use of a zoe - based temporary cement affected negatively the sbs of the luting agent used for final cementation .	0
a comparison of two human cell lines and two rat gonadal cell primary cultures as in vitro screening tools for aromatase modulation .. environmental toxicants are a serious health concern , and numerous studies have been devoted to studying the effects of environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ). the balance between androgens and estrogens controls the function of many edc - sensitive organs , and the aromatase enzyme plays a key role in maintaining this balance . in vitro studies have suggested that aromatase expression and activity is a promising biomarker for initial screenings of putative hormonal disrupting compounds . to further validate the aromatase biomarker , we tested several edcs ( atrazine , bisphenol a , methoxychlor , methoxychlor metabolite hpte , vinclozolin , vinclozolin metabolite m2 ) in four different models ( human cell lines h295r and jeg - 3 , rat primary cultures of granulosa and leydig cells ). we evaluated the similarities / differences in the chemical impact on aromatase mrna levels and enzymatic activity for the different species and cell types . aromatase gene expression was assessed by q - rt - pcr , and enzymatic activity was assessed via a tritiated water method with either intact cells or isolated microsomes . the aromatase gene mrna levels and cellular enzymatic activity varied between the four different models tested , which suggests that the edc effect varies among different cell types . however , regulation of microsomal aromatase activity appeared to be conserved across all the species and cell types tested . these results suggest that several well characterized complementary cellular models are required to fully characterize the effects of putative edcs and predict the in vivo effects .	0
cytotoxicity , genotoxicity and ecotoxicity assay using human cell and environmental species for the screening of the risk from pollutant exposure .. for the screening of the risk from environmental contamination , the cytotoxic / genotoxic effects of various model pollutants were determined using an in vivo system comprised of human hela cells ; the ecotoxicity was also determined using the acute and genotoxicity tests on two aquatic sentinel species widely used in biomonitoring , namely , freshwater crustacean , daphnia magna and larva of aquatic midge , chironomus tentans . nonylphenol ( np ), bisphenol a ( bpa ), bis ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( deph ) and paraquat dichloride ( pq ) were used as the model pollutants . the results showed that exposure of hela cells to np , bpa and dehp was sufficient for the expression of noticeable genotoxic and cytotoxic effects . ecotoxicity results showed that , as expected , d . magna was more sensitive than c . tentans to chemical exposure . bpa may exert a genotoxic effect on d . magna and c . tentans , given that dna strand breaks increased in both species exposed to this compound , whereas np - induced dna damage occurred only in c . tentans . in vivo genotoxic data obtained in aquatic sentinel species could provide valuable information for freshwater quality monitoring . from the results of the present study , the use of cytotoxic , genotoxic and ecotoxic tests using human cell system , as well as , biomonitoring species , seems to be relevant for preliminary evaluation of the human health and ecological effects of pollutants and thus , a promising screening tool for environmental monitoring and risk assessment .	0
recent advances in mass spectrometry analysis of phenolic endocrine disruptors and related compounds .. this article reviews recent literature on current methodologies based on chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to analyze phenolic compounds with endocrine - disrupting capabilities . for this review we chose alkylphenol ethoxylates , bisphenol a , bisphenol f , and their degradation products and halogenated derivatives , which are considered important environmental contaminants . additionally , some related compounds such as bisphenol diglycidylethers were included . growing attention has been paid to the mass spectrometric characterization of these compounds and the instrumentation and strategies used for their quantification and confirmation . the current use of gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ) and liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ( lc - ms ) methodologies with different mass spectrometers and ionization and monitoring modes is discussed . practical aspects with regards to the use of these analytical techniques , such as derivatizing reagents in gc - ms , ion suppression in lc - ms , and the most problematic aspects of quantification , are included in the discussion .	0
temperature dependence of the characteristic length scale for glassy dynamics : combination of dielectric and specific heat spectroscopy .. the temperature dependence of characteristic length scales associated to the glass transition such as the cooperativity length scale introduced by adam and gibbs [ cooperative rearranging region ( crr )] or the dynamic heterogeneity as estimated from the four point correlation function chi4 , is at the center of large interests . broadband dielectric spectroscopy and temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry allow to study the crr size temperature dependence in the temperature range of ergodicity loss for glass - forming liquids , starting from the onset of cooperativity in the crossover region down to the glass transition temperature . furthermore , the correlation between these two techniques allows to explore a large frequency range ( from 1 mhz to 10 mhz ). the goal of this work is to follow the cooperativity evolution along the arrhenius plot for two different polymeric systems : poly ( ethylene 1 , 4 - cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate glycol ) and poly ( bisphenol a carbonate ).	0
direct bonding to typodont teeth .. three methods of bonding orthodontic brackets to acrylic teeth were investigated for use with a typodont . one - hundred - and - twenty dentaurum 0 . 018 x 0 . 025 inch standard edgewise brackets were bonded to crylopax cross - linked acrylic teeth using three cements : concise composite , concise with acrylic primer , and gac acrylic cement on a previously roughened tooth surface . half the specimens in each group was immersed in a thermostatically controlled water bath for 15 min on 20 occasions over a 5 - day period , to simulate the conditions of a typodont , prior to measuring tensile bond strength on an instron machine . under dry conditions concise composite was significantly stronger than either concise with acrylic primer or gac cold cure acrylic resin . under wet conditions , however , the mean bond strength of the acrylic resin increased significantly compared to the other cements . the bond strength of both concise and concise composite with primer deteriorated following water immersion . it is suggested that when setting up typodont teeth with brackets bonded with gac acrylic resin , immersion of the bonded teeth in hot water prior to positioning of the teeth in the typodont may greatly reduce the risk of subsequent bracket loss .	0
disruption of thyroid hormone - dependent hypothalamic set - points by environmental contaminants .. the hypothalamus integrates metabolic and endocrine signals . as such it represents a potential target for a wide spectrum of endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ). we investigated hypothalamic effects of two environmentally abundant xenobiotics , the flame - retardant tetrabromo bisphenol a ( tbbpa ) and the anti - fouling agent tributyltin ( tbt ). these edcs affect endocrine signalling through different nuclear receptors including the thyroid hormone receptor ( tr ) or its partner , the retinoid x receptor ( rxr ). promoter sequences of two hypothalamic genes implicated in metabolic control and regulated by thyroid hormone , thyrotropin - releasing hormone ( trh ) and type 4 melanocortin receptor ( mc4r ), were studied in vivo using reporter assays . chronic exposure of gestating dams or acute exposure of their newborns to tbbpa abrogated activation of both trh and mc4r transcription . exposure of lactating dams to tbt amplified activation of trh without affecting mc4r transcription . thus , perinatal exposure to edcs affecting nuclear receptor signalling modulates hypothalamic set - points controlling metabolic responses .	0
detecting endocrine disrupting compounds in water using sulfur - oxidizing bacteria .. for the rapid and reliable detection of endocrine disrupting compounds in water , a novel toxicity detection methodology based on sulfur - oxidizing bacteria ( sob ) has been developed . the methodology exploits the ability of sob to oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfuric acid in the presence of oxygen . the reaction results in an increase in electrical conductivity ( ec ) and a decrease in ph . when endocrine disrupting compounds were added to the system , the effluent ec decreased and the ph increased due to the inhibition of the sob . we found that the system can detect these chemicals in the 50 - 200 ppb range , which is lower than many whole - cell biosensors to date . the sob biosensor can detect toxicity on the order of min to h which can serve as an early warning so as to not pollute the environment and affect public health .	0
tensile bond force of glass ionomer cements in direct bonding of orthodontic brackets : an in vitro comparative study .. tensile bond force of three glass ionomers was evaluated in vitro . ketac - cem and aqua - cem , two conventional cements , and light - cured vitrabond were used in this study . the results were then compared with the values obtained for a composite resin ( concise ) by means of the mann - whitney two - sample rank test adjusted for ties . the composite resin had a significantly higher bond force ( 152 . 5 n ) than any of the other adhesives ( 5 . 5 to 27 . 53 n ) used . tensile bond strength was also calculated and the failure bond site investigated on the enamel surface was evaluated . the composite resin and the two conventional glass ionomers used had high cement percentages ( 86 % to 62 %) adhering to the enamel surface . cement remaining on enamel was lower ( 20 %) for the light - cured glass ionomer . it was concluded that the in vitro bond force of vitrabond might be adequate for orthodontic bracket bonding .	0
removal of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products ( ppcps ) and endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) during sand filtration and ozonation at a municipal sewage treatment plant .. we investigated the efficiencies of removal of 24 pharmaceutically active compounds ( phacs ) during sand filtration and ozonation in an operating municipal sewage treatment plant ( stp ). the target compounds were 2 phenolic antiseptics ( thymol , triclosan ), 5 acidic analgesics or anti - inflammatories ( ibuprofen , naproxen , ketoprofen , fenoprofen , mefenamic acid ), 4 amide pharmaceuticals ( propyphenazone , crotamiton , carbamazepine , diethyltoluamide ), 7 antibiotics ( sulfapyridine , sulfamethoxazole , trimethoprim , azithromycin , erythromycin anhydride , clarithromycin , roxithromycin ), 3 phenolic endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) ( nonylphenol : np , octylphenol : op , bisphenol a : bpa ) and 3 natural estrogens ( 17 beta - estradiol : e2 , estrone : e1 , estriol : e3 ). ozonation removed approximately 80 % or more of the phenolic antiseptics , crotamiton , sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics , and 17 beta - estradiol . their removal is discussed in terms of chemical structure . the study ascertained the validity of ozonation mechanisms proposed by previous studies in an actually running stp . compounds with a cc double bond or an aromatic structure with electron donors ( e . g ., phenol , alkyl , methoxy , or non - protonated amine ) were susceptible to ozonation . compounds with amide structures were resistant . removal of the phacs during sand filtration was generally inefficient , probably because of their low hydrophobicities . the combination of ozonation and sand filtration with activated sludge treatment gave efficient removal (> 80 %) of all the target compounds except carbamazepine and diethyltoluamide . among all the steps in the plant , ozonation contributed substantially to overall removal of naproxen , ketoprofen , triclosan , crotamiton , sulfapyridine , macrolide antibiotics , and estrone .	0
bisphenol a ( bpa ) daily intakes in the united states : estimates from the 2003 - 2004 nhanes urinary bpa data .. investigations into human exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) have , for the most part , assessed intake based on food consumption estimates combined with measurements or estimates of bpa in foods . in this study , nationally representative data on urinary levels of bpa in the united states ( us ) from the 2003 - 2004 national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) were used to estimate daily intake of bpa , assuming steady - state excretion . distributions of intakes for the us population were determined for ( i ) all nhanes participants with urinary bpa data ; ( ii ) participants by the following age groups : 6 - 11 years , 12 - 19 years , 20 - 39 years , 40 - 59 years , and 60 + years ; and ( iii ) participants by gender . on the basis of the nhanes urinary bpa data and the assumptions described in this paper , daily bpa intakes for male participants are statistically significantly higher than for female participants , and there are statistically significant differences in daily bpa intakes according to age groups , with the oldest group having the lowest estimated intakes . median intake was approximately three orders of magnitude below health - based guidance values of 50 microg / kg - day .	0
exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds via the food chain : is packaging a relevant source ?. contamination of foodstuffs by environmental pollutants ( e . g . dioxins , metals ) receives much attention . until recently , food packaging as a source of xenobiotics , especially those with endocrine disrupting properties , has received little awareness despite its ubiquitous use . this article reviews the regulations and use of endocrine disrupting compounds ( edcs ) in food packaging and discusses their presence within the context of new toxicology paradigms . i focused on substances known to be legally used in food packaging that have been shown to exhibit endocrine disruptive effects in biological systems . i compiled a list of 50 known or potential edcs used in food contact materials and examined data of edcs leaching from packaging into food , with a focus on nonylphenol . i included recent advances in toxicology : mixture effects , the developmental origins of adult disease hypothesis , low - dose effects , and epigenetics . i especially considered the case of bisphenol a . the core hypothesis of this review is that chemicals leaching from packaging into food contribute to human edcs exposure and might lead to chronic disease in light of the current knowledge . food contact materials are a major source of food contaminants . many migrating compounds , possibly with endocrine disruptive properties , remain unidentified . there is a need for information on identity / quantity of chemicals leaching into food , human exposure , and long - term impact on health . especially edcs in food packaging are of concern . even at low concentrations , chronic exposure to edcs is toxicologically relevant . concerns increase when humans are exposed to mixtures of similar acting edcs and / or during sensitive windows of development . in particular , non - intentionally added substances ( nias ) migrating from food contact materials need toxicological characterization ; the overall migrate of the finished packaging could be evaluated for biological effects using bioassays . the widespread legal use of edcs in food packaging requires dedicated assessment and should be updated according to contemporary scientific knowledge .	0
sensitivity of expression of perivitelline membrane glycoprotein zp1 mrna in the liver of japanese quail ( coturnix japonica ) to estrogenic compounds .. avian perivitelline membrane protein , zp1 , is synthesized and secreted by the liver with the stimulation of estrogens . in the present study , we measured the expression of zp1 gene in the liver of immature male quail treated with various estrogenic compounds and in the liver of male quail embryos that were developed in the fertilized eggs laid by mother quail injected with various estrogenic compounds during vitellogenesis . total rna extracted from the liver was reverse - transcribed and cdna was subjected to real - time pcr . both diethylstilbestrol and ethinyl estradiol caused significant effect on the increase in mrna in immature male quail . in contrast , diethylstilbestrol administered via the route of maternal injection was not effective for induction of embryonic mrna , although the effect of ethinyl estradiol administered via the same route was prominent . these results showed that direct administration of estrogenic compounds , diethylstilbestrol and ethinyl estradiol , stimulates the induction of zp1 gene , but the rate of accumulation of these compounds in the yolk is different during vitellogenesis . the present studies suggest that although zp1 gene is a sensitive biomarker to evaluate the effects of endocrine disruptors , the route of administration is an important factor to compare the effectiveness .	0
epigenetic perspective on the developmental effects of bisphenol a .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is an estrogenic environmental toxin widely used in the production of plastics and ubiquitous human exposure to this chemical has been proposed to be a potential risk to public health . animal studies suggest that in utero and early postnatal exposure to this compound may produce a broad range of adverse effects , including impaired brain development , sexual differentiation , behavior , and immune function , which could extend to future generations . molecular mechanisms that underlie the long - lasting effects of bpa continue to be elucidated , and likely involve disruption of epigenetic programming of gene expression during development . several studies have provided evidence that maternal exposure to bpa results in postnatal changes in dna methylation status and altered expression of specific genes in offspring . however , further studies are needed to extend these initial findings to other genes in different tissues , and to examine the correlations between bpa - induced epigenetic alterations , changes in gene expression , and various phenotypic outcomes . it will be also important to explore whether the epigenetic effects of bpa are related to its estrogenic activity , and to determine which downstream effector proteins could mediate changes in dna methylation . in this review , we will highlight research indicating a consequence of prenatal bpa exposure for brain , behavior , and immune outcomes and discuss evidence for the role of epigenetic pathways in shaping these developmental effects . based on this evidence , we will suggest future directions in the study of bpa - induced epigenetic effects and discuss the transgenerational implications of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals .	0

sample clean - up with sol - gel enzyme and immunoaffinity columns for the determination of bisphenol a in human urine .. the paper describes the development of a simple and highly selective analytical method for the determination of free and total bisphenol a in urine samples . free bisphenol a levels can be determined after sample clean - up using sol - gel immunoaffinity columns containing anti - bisphenol a antibodies . in determining total bisphenol a levels , the sample pre - treatment procedure consists of sample preparation using an on - line combination of two sol - gel columns , an enzyme column containing glucuronidase and arylsulfatase , and an immunoaffinity column . bisphenol a can then be quantified by high - performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection . the mean recovery was found to be 78 % with a standard deviation of 3 . 4 %, the lod ( s / n = 3 ) was 0 . 2 ng / ml . the method was applied to determine free and total urinary bpa levels of healthy adults and dialysis patients .	0
influence of drying time and temperature on bond strength of contemporary adhesives to dentine .. objectives : to evaluate the bond strength ( microtbs ) of self - etching adhesives in different solvent evaporation conditions . methods : flat dentine surfaces from extracted human third molars were bonded with : ( 1 ) 2 two - steps self - etching adhesives ( clearfil se bond - cseb ); ( protect bond - pb ) and ( 2 ) 2 one - step self - etch systems ( adper prompt l pop - adplp ); ( xeno iii - xiii ). bonded dentine surfaces were air - dried for 5s , 20s , 30s or 40s at either 21 degrees c or 38 degrees c . composite build - ups were constructed incrementally . after storage in water for 24h at 37 degrees c , the specimens were prepared for microtensile bond strength testing . data were analyzed by two - way anova and student - newman - keuls at alpha = 0 . 05 . results : cseb and pb performed better at warm temperature with only 20s of air - blowing . the bond strength increased when xiii was performed at warm temperature at 40s air - blowing . extended air - blowing not affect the performance of adplp , except at 30s air - blowing time at warm temperature . conclusions : the use of a warm air - dry stream seems to be a clinical tool to improve the bond strength to self - etching adhesives .	0
nanofiller loading level : influence on selected properties of an adhesive resin .. objectives : to evaluate the effect of the filler content in the cohesive strength ( sigma ), weibull modulus ( m ) and degree of conversion ( dc ) of an experimental adhesive system . methods : a hema / bis - gma / tegdma - based adhesive was formulated and filled with silica nanofillers in the following weight percentages ( wt %): r0 = 0 %; r1 = 1 %; r3 = 3 %; r5 = 5 % and r10 = 10 %. the adhesive of adper scotchbond multi - purpose ( sbmp ) system was used as a commercial reference . twenty dumbbell - shaped specimens with cross - sectional area of 0 . 5mm ( 2 ) were made per group and tensile tested with a crosshead speed of 0 . 5mm / min until fracture . the cohesive strength was calculated in mpa . dc was obtained through ftir after light curing for 25s . data were submitted to one - way anova and tukey ' s test ( alpha = 0 . 05 ) and to weibull analysis . results : mean sigma results were : r0 = 65 . 4 +/- 8 . 4 ; r1 = 73 . 2 +/- 8 . 8 ; r3 = 72 . 0 +/- 8 . 4 ; r5 = 73 . 1 +/- 9 . 7 ; r10 = 85 . 5 +/- 13 . 1 and sbmp = 79 . 0 +/- 11 . 0mpa . r10 presented the highest sigma , while r0 showed the lowest . r5 and sbmp did not differ significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ). weibull analysis revealed no significant difference in structural reliability between groups . the experimental adhesives presented similar results of dc , which , in turn , were significantly higher than the sbmp . conclusions : the addition of 10 % filler in weight improves the cohesive strength of the adhesive , not interfering in the structural reliability or the degree of conversion .	0
assessing the quantitative relationships between preschool children ' s exposures to bisphenol a by route and urinary biomonitoring .. limited published information exists on young children ' s exposures to bisphenol a ( bpa ) in the united states using urinary biomonitoring . in a previous project , we quantified the aggregate exposures of 257 preschool children to bpa in environmental and personal media over 48 - h periods in 2000 - 2001 at homes and daycares in north carolina and ohio . in the present study for 81 ohio preschool children ages 23 - 64 months , we quantified the children ' s urinary total bpa ( free and conjugated ) concentrations over these same 48 - h periods in 2001 . then , we examined the quantitative relationships between the children ' s intakes doses of bpa through the dietary ingestion , nondietary ingestion , and inhalation routes and their excreted amounts of urinary bpa . bpa was detected in 100 % of the urine samples . the estimated median intake doses of bpa for these 81 children were 109 ng / kg / day ( dietary ingestion ), 0 . 06 ng / kg / day ( nondietary ingestion ), and 0 . 27 ng / kg / day ( inhalation ); their estimated median excreted amount of urinary bpa was 114 ng / kg / day . our multivariable regression model showed that dietary intake of bpa ( p = 0 . 04 ) and creatinine concentration ( p = 0 . 004 ) were significant predictors of urinary bpa excretion , collectively explaining 17 % of the variability in excretion . dietary ingestion of bpa accounted for > 95 % of the children ' s excreted amounts of urinary bpa .	0
low - level bisphenol a increases production of glial fibrillary acidic protein in differentiating astrocyte progenitor cells through excessive stat3 and smad1 activation .. the effects of bisphenol a ( bpa ) on the differentiation of serum - free mouse embryo ( sfme ) cells , the astrocyte progenitor cells in the central nervous system , were examined . sfme cells were exposed to 10 ng / ml leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) and 10ng / ml bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( bmp2 ) to increase glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) expression and induce cell differentiation . various concentrations of bpa ( 0 . 1 pg / ml - 1 microg / ml ) were then added to determine their effects on the cell differentiation . sfme cells were effectively differentiated by lif and bmp2 in completely serum - free cultures . cell proliferation following cell differentiation was not significantly affected by low - level bpa . however , gfap expression was significantly increased in sfme cells in the presence of 1 - 100 pg / ml bpa . these increases were due to excessive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( stat3 ) and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1 ( smad1 ) by the low - level bpa .	0
human exposure to bisphenol a .. bisphenol a ( bpa ), 2 , 2 - bis ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) propane , is made by combining acetone and phenol . it has estrogenic activity and is acutely toxic to aquatic organisms . bpa is used mainly as a material for the production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics . due to an increase in products based on epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics , human exposure to bpa has increased . the environment ( aquatic environment , air and soil ) can be one source of human bpa exposure , but the primary route of human exposure is foods . the daily human intake of bpa is < 1 microg / kg body weight / day on the basis of several studies , and whether these doses can have an adverse endocrine disruptive effect on humans , especially fetuses , needs to be studied carefully .	0
structural requirements for inhibitory effects of bisphenols on the activity of the sarco / endoplasmic reticulum calcium atpase .. bisphenols ( bps ) are a class of small organic compounds with widespread industrial applications . previous studies have identified several bps that interfere with the activity of the ion - translocating enzyme sarco / endoplasmic reticulum calcium atpase ( serca ). in order to define the molecular determinants of bp - mediated serca inhibition , we conducted enzyme activity assays with rabbit serca to determine the inhibitory potencies of 27 commercially available bps , which were the basis for structure - activity relationships . the most potent bps inhibited serca at low micromolar concentrations and carried at their two phenyl rings multiple non - polar substituents , such as small alkyl groups or halides . furthermore , the presence of methyl groups or a cyclohexyl group at the central carbon atom connecting the two phenyl moieties correlated with good potencies . for a characterization and visualization of enzyme / inhibitor interactions , molecular docking was performed , which suggested that hydrogen bonding with asp254 and hydrophobic interactions were the major driving forces for bp binding to serca . calcium imaging studies with a selection of bps showed that these inhibitors were able to increase intracellular calcium levels in living human cells , a behavior consistent with that of a serca inhibitor .	0
"""corticosterone - regulated actions in the rat brain are affected by perinatal exposure to low dose of bisphenol a .. the estrogen - mimicking endocrine disrupter bisphenol a ( bpa ) which is used in the manufacture of plastic and epoxy resins , is one of the world ' s most heavily produced synthetic chemicals . bpa is detected in animal tissues , and its bio - accumulation has shown to be higher in the fetus than the mother . exposure to doses below the daily safe limit has been reported to affect the sexual differentiation of the brain and modify the behavior of the exposed rodent offspring . the aim of the present study was to investigate in the rat the possible organizational effects of low bpa exposure on glucocorticoid - regulated responses . female breeders were exposed to 40 microg / kg b . w . bpa daily throughout pregnancy and lactation . plasma corticosterone levels and the two types of hippocampal corticosteroid receptors ( gr and mr ) were determined in mid - adolescent offspring under basal conditions and following a y - maze task . bpa treated females had higher corticosterone levels than control females and bpa males and lower gr levels than bpa males , under basal conditions . following the mildly stressful experience of y - maze , corticosterone levels were increased in bpa - treated animals of both sexes , compared to the controls . gr levels were also increased in bpa - treated females compared to males . no effect of bpa was observed on mr levels , whereas the y - maze experience significantly decreased receptors ' levels in both female groups . the animals ' performance in the task was also evaluated . bpa exposure significantly impaired the spatial recognition memory in both sexes , and modified the behavioural coping in a sex - dependent manner . female bpa - treated offspring exhibited increased """" anxiety - like """" behaviour and dramatic loss of exploration attitude during the task , in comparison to males . this study provides for the first time evidence that corticosterone and its actions in the brain are sensitive to the programming effects of bpa at a dose below the currently acceptable daily intake ."""	1
[ function of dj - 1 in mitochondria ].. parkinson ' s disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system caused by selective dopamine - generating cell death , and oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be responsible for the onset of parkinson ' s disease . while most cases of parkinson ' s disease are idiopathic , 5 - 10 % of cases are attributed to genetic factors . dj - 1 was first identified as an activated ras - dependent oncogene and later found to be a causative gene for a familial form of parkinson ' s disease , park7 . we and others found that dj - 1 plays roles in transcriptional regulation and anti - oxidative stress function , and loss of its function is thought to affect the onset of parkinson ' s disease . dj - 1 is mainly located in the cytoplasma and nucleus and partially in mitochondria . when mice or mouse cells were treated with bisphenol a , an endocrine disruptor and inducer of reactive oxygen species , dj - 1 was translocated into mitochondria to maintain mitochondrial complex i activity . we also found that dj - 1 directly bound to and was co - localized with ndufa4 and nd1 , nuclear and mitochondrial dna - encoding subunits of mitochondrial complex i , respectively , and that these associations were enhanced by oxidative stress . furthermore , complex i activity was reduced in two types of dj - 1 - knockdown nih3t3 and hek293 cells . these findings suggest that dj - 1 is an integral mitochondrial protein and maintains mitochondrial complex i activity to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis .	0
the effect on coronal leakage of liquid adhesive application over root fillings after smear layer removal with edta or er : yag laser .. objective : to evaluate coronal microleakage in filled root canals that received different biomechanical preparations and application of liquid adhesives over the root filling and the pulp chamber walls . study design : root canals of 94 extracted canine teeth were filled after being biomechanically prepared with 1 % sodium hypochlorite and divided into 3 groups . in 2 groups attempts were made to remove the smear layer with either 17 % edta or er : yag laser irradiation ( 10 hz , 250 mj input , 112 mj output ). liquid adhesive ( super bonder and single bond adhesive ) was applied and the teeth were immersed for 90 days in india ink . results : statistically significant differences were found for the different preparations , the use of liquid adhesives , and the different liquid adhesives . the use of er : yag laser , edta , and the liquid adhesive reduced coronal microleakage ( p < . 01 ). conclusions : because of the risk of coronal microleakage , endodontically treated teeth should be restored as quickly as possible .	0
intra - oral adhesive systems for ceramic repairs : a comparison .. the aim of this investigation was to compare the bond strength of restorative composite resin to dental ceramic conditioned with primers and adhesives of various commercial repair kits . three intra - oral ceramic repair systems -- silistor ( heraeus kulzer ), cimara ( voco ), ceramic repair ( vivadent )-- were used on all - ceramic ( ips empress 2 , ivoclar - vivadent ) substrate . shear bond strength of restorative composite resin to substrate was tested after thermocycling and without thermocycling ( n = 10 ). substrate surfaces of the specimen after loading were examined microscopically ( sem ). the highest bond strengths in both water - stored ( 7 . 0 +/- 5 . 7 mpa ) and thermocycled conditions ( 2 . 5 +/- 1 . 8 mpa ) were obtained with the vivadent repair system , while the lowest values were observed with the cimara system ( 0 . 6 +/- 1 . 4 mpa and 0 . 0 +/- 0 . 0 mpa , respectively ). shear bond strengths appeared to be significantly affected by thermocycling ( anova , p < 0 . 05 ). it is concluded that there are significant differences in the bond strengths of resin composites and ceramic substrate . the roughened surface does not necessarily provide a better bond strength ; the bond strength of composite decreases with storage in water and after thermocycling . bond strength values were generally low for all of the tested materials .	0
enamel wetness effects on bond strength using different adhesive systems .. objective : to evaluate , through the application of different dentin bonding systems , the influence of wetness on shear bond strength in enamel . methods : this study evaluated three etch - and - rinse adhesive systems ( scotchbond mp [ used with and without primer ]; singlebond ; and prime & bond 2 . 1 ) and two self - etching adhesive systems ( clearfil se bond ; and xeno iv ). flat bovine enamel surfaces were either air - dried for 30 seconds or blotted with absorbent paper after acid - etching for the conventional bonding agents or before the application of self - etching bonding agents . the resin composite esthetx was bonded to flat surfaces that had been treated with one of the adhesives , following the manufacturer ' s instructions . after being stored in water at 37 ° c for one week , bonded specimens were broken in shear . data were evaluated with two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) and student - newman - keuls tests ( α = 0 . 05 ). for comparing each condition individually , regardless of the adhesive or wetness condition , a one - way anova and a student - newman - keuls test ( α = 0 . 05 ) were applied . results : the two - way anova showed significant differences among adhesive systems . an interaction effect was also observed ( p < 0 . 05 ), but wetness did not influence shear bond strength ( p = 0 . 98 ). the one - way anova showed that the all - in - one adhesive was the only material influenced by the presence of water at the enamel ' s surface . conclusion : the all - in - one adhesive behaved differently depending on whether the enamel surface was dry or wet .	0
effects of 17α - ethinylestradiol and bisphenol a on steroidogenic messenger ribonucleic acid levels in the rare minnow gonads .. previous studies showed that the endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) affect reproductive physiology in teleosts . how the edcs regulate gonadal steroidogenesis remains to be determined . the gonadal transcript changes of steroidogenic enzyme genes in adult rare minnow gobiocypris rarus exposed to 17α - ethinylestradiol ( ee2 ) and bisphenol a ( bpa ) were detected in the present study . the full - length cdnas encoding steroidogenic enzymes , including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ( star ), cytochrome p450 - mediated side - chain cleavage enzyme ( cyp11a1 ), 3β - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( 3β - hsd ), and cytochrome p450 17 a1 ( cyp17a1 ) were isolated and characterized by rt - pcr and race methods . the homology and phylogenetic analyses of the amino acid sequences confirmed that the nucleotide sequences of these steroidogenic genes were correct . the mrna tissue distribution results indicated that star , cyp11a1 , and cyp17a1 mrnas were mainly expressed in the gonads and 3β - hsd was mainly expressed in both the gonads and the brains . the 233 dpf adult g . rarus were exposed to ee2 ( 25ng / l ) and bpa ( 5 , 15 , and 50 μg / l ) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) or control for 7 days . the gonadal mrna levels of star , cyp11a1 , 3β - hsd , cyp17a1 and ovarian cytochrome p450 aromatase ( cyp19a1a ) were quantified by qrt - pcr . our data indicated that 25 ng / l ee2 had different degrees of inhibitory effects on the expression of steroidogenic genes in the gonads . bpa at different levels caused concentration - specific effects on the mrna expression of the steroidogenic genes . the transcripts of several ovarian steroidogenic genes were more sensitive to 15 μg / l bpa than that at other two levels . these findings suggest that ee2 could impair gonadal steroidogenesis by suppressing mrna expression of steroidogenic genes and bpa could cause variations in gonadal steroidogenesis modulation with a potential consequence of compensation for the disturbance .	0
urinary bisphenol - a concentration in infertile japanese women and its association with endometriosis : a cross - sectional study .. objectives : bisphenol a ( bpa ), a raw material commonly used in the manufacture of resins such as polycarbonate and epoxy , is a possible xenoestrogen that is hypothesized to disrupt the human endocrine system . humans are widely exposed to bpa . we investigated the urinary concentration of bpa in infertile japanese women and its possible association with endometriosis . materials and methods : we recruited 166 women ( aged 20 - 45 ) who had complained of infertility and visited a university hospital in tokyo . the subjects were interviewed and their urine samples were obtained prior to a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis between january 2000 and december 2001 . urinary total bpa concentration in 140 eligible urine samples was then measured using enzymatic deconjugation of glucuronide and sulfate and high - performance liquid chromatography isotope - dilution tandem mass spectrometry . results : median ( 25th - 75th percentile ) unadjusted and creatinine - adjusted urinary bpa concentrations were 1 . 6 ( 0 . 69 - 2 . 8 ) μg / l and 0 . 80 ( 0 . 45 - 1 . 3 ) μg / g creatinine . no significant monotonic association of endometriosis with urinary bpa concentration was observed . median urinary bpa concentration in women with stage 0 - 1 endometriosis ( 0 . 74 μg / g creatinine ) did not significantly differ from that in those with stage ii - iv endometriosis ( 0 . 93 μg / g creatinine ) ( p for difference = 0 . 24 ). conclusions : this study , based on a larger number of samples than those in previous studies in japan and using the most reliable analytical method currently available , showed that urinary concentrations of bpa in women who consulted a physician for infertility were not higher than those in other populations . moreover , no association between urinary bpa concentration and endometriosis was found in this cross - sectional study .	0
retention of three fissure sealants and a dentin bonding system used as fissure sealant in caries prevention : 12 - month follow - up results .. background : bonding agents could be used as fissure sealants . this study compares the retention three fissure sealants ( delton , delton plus and concise ) and a filled dentin bonding system ( optibond solo ). methods . fifty - six children aged 7 - 8 years received fissure sealants either in the four permanent first molars , in the four deciduous second molars , or in all eight of these teeth . every child received a different sealing material in each quadrant on a random basis . clinical evaluation at 12 months was performed by a single blind examiner , and the retention was classified as either a success ( total retention ) or a failure ( partial retention or not present ). results : there were no statistically significant differences among the four materials in permanent maxillary molars or deciduous molars . in permanent mandibular molars , optibond solo showed a lower percentage of retention ( 40 . 9 %), significantly different ( p = 0 . 002 ) to that of delton ( 89 . 5 %), delton plus ( 87 . 5 %) and concise ( 76 . 5 %). conclusion : one bottle dentin bonding system used as a sealant does not improve the retention of conventional fissure sealants . clinical implication : because of the scarcity of studies on the use of dental adhesives as sealants , further studies are warranted for the final support of that conclusion .	0
non - occupational contact sensitization to epoxy resin of bisphenol a among general dermatology patients .. background : sensitization to epoxy resins often results from occupational exposure in various fields of construction and industry . non - occupational sensitization sources and environments have remained overlooked . objectives : to analyse non - occupational and occupational contact sensitization to epoxy resin of bisphenol a among general dermatology patients . special attention was paid to patients sensitized from non - occupational sources . patients and methods : during a 10 - year period , 6042 general dermatology patients were patch tested with epoxy resin ( bisphenol a ) in the dermatology clinic of turku university hospital . the clinical data and the sources of occupational and non - occupational exposure to epoxy resin were analysed in sensitized patients . results : epoxy resin sensitization was found in 59 patients . non - occupational sensitization was found in 21 ( 35 %) patients , whereas the number of occupational cases was 38 ( 65 %). the most common sources of non - occupational epoxy resin sensitization were materials used in domestic renovation and construction projects and in boat repair . conclusions : non - occupational sensitization sources account for approximately one - third of epoxy resin sensitization cases , and therefore represent an important risk among hobbies and leisure activities .	0
"""epigenetics and chemical safety assessment .. epigenetics , as it pertains to biology and toxicology , can be defined as heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve mutations and are propagated without continued stimulus . although potentially reversible , these heritable changes may be classified as mitotic , meiotic , or transgenerational , implicating the wide - ranging impact of epigenetic control in cellular function . a number of biological responses have been classified as being caused by an """" epigenetic alteration ,"""" sometimes based on sound scientific evidence and often in lieu of an identified genetic mutation . complicating the understanding and interpretation of perceived epigenetic alterations is an incomplete understanding of the normal state and dynamic variation of the epigenome , which can differ widely between cell and tissue types and stage of development or age . this emerging field is likely to have a profound impact on the study and practice of toxicology in coming years . this document reviews the current state of the science in epigenetic modifications , techniques used to measure these changes , and evaluates the current toxicology testing battery with respect to strengths and potential weaknesses in the identification of epigenetics changes . in addition , case studies implicating transgenerational effects induced by diethylstilbestrol , vinclozolin , and bisphenol a were reviewed to illustrate the application of epigenetics in safety assessment and the strengths and limitations of the study designs . an assessment of toxicology tests currently used in safety evaluation revealed that these tests are expected to identify any potential adverse outcomes resulting from epigenetic changes . furthermore , in order to increase our understanding of the science of epigenetics in toxicology , this review has revealed that a solid understanding of the biology and variation in the epigenome is essential to contextualize concerns about possible adverse health effects related to epigenetic changes . finally , the fundamental principles guiding toxicology studies , including relevant doses , dose - rates , routes of exposure , and experimental models , need to be taken into consideration in the design and interpretation of studies within this emerging area of science ."""	0
the binding site of bisphenol a to protein disulphide isomerase .. protein disulphide isomerase ( pdi ) has been isolated as a binding protein of bisphenol a ( bpa ) in the rat brain . in this study , we determined binding sites of bpa to pdi and characterized the binding site . first , we identified the bpa - binding domain with ab , b ' a ' c , a , b , b ' and a ' c fragment peptides of pdi by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy . bpa interacted with ab , b ' a ' c , a and b ', suggesting that a and b ' domains are important in their interaction . second , ab , b ' a ' c , a , b , b ', a ', abb ' a ', abb ', b ' a ', δb ' and a ' c fragment peptides were used for their isomerase activity with rnase as a substrate . bpa could inhibit the activity of peptide fragments including b ', suggesting that b ' domain contributes to inhibition of catalytic activity of pdi by bpa . next , we investigated the bpa - binding capacity of pdi by amino acid substitution . pdi lost the bpa - binding activity by the mutation of h258 and mutation of q245 and n300 also decreased its activity . furthermore , acidic condition increased the bpa - binding activity of pdi . these results suggest that the charge of these amino acid especially , h258 , is important for the bpa to bind to pdi .	0
response of mcf - 7 human breast cancer cells to some binary mixtures of oestrogenic compounds in - vitro .. the effects of simultaneous administration of some binary mixtures of seven natural and synthetic oestrogenic substances ( 17beta - estradiol , estrone , bisphenol a , butylbenzyl phthalate , endosulfan , methoxychlor and pentachlorophenol ) on the cellular proliferation of human breast cancer mcf - 7 cells in - vitro ( a modified e - screen assay ) have been measured . to assess the presence or absence of interactions of the two agents , the data were analysed on the basis of a graphical method in which the types and extents of interactions were described by response - surface diagrams . of the nine combinations of the agents examined , synergistic interaction was evident for the combination of 17beta - estradiol and bisphenol a , whereas the remaining eight combinations were weakly synergistic , additive and / or weakly antagonistic in the dose - range tested .	0
long term effects of pre - and early postnatal nutrition and environment on the gut .. the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis formulated in the early 1990 s has stimulated research on long - term effects of early nutrition and environment over the last decades . long - term is understood in this review as physiologically relevant periods such as after weaning , around sexual maturity , and in adulthood , as opposed to early developmental periods . the small and large intestines as targets for the study of long - term effects have received little attention until recent years and the stomach has been considered very rarely . data have accumulated for laboratory animal models but they are still scarce in the swine species . following the epidemics of metabolic diseases and obesity in western countries , experimental evidence has been published showing that nutritional factors , including energy , fat and fatty acids , protein , and micronutrients impact various facets of gut function . these include alterations in intestinal digestive , absorptive , secretory , barrier , and defense systems , often in a way potentially detrimental to the host . environmental factors with long - term influence include stress ( e . g ., maternal deprivation , neonatal gut irritation ), chemical pollutants ( e . g ., bisphenol a ), and gut microbiota disturbances ( e . g ., by antibiotics ). examples of such long - term effects on the gut are provided in both laboratory animals and pigs together with underlying physiological mechanisms whenever available . experimental evidence for the involvement of underlying epigenetic modifications ( e . g ., genomic dna methylation ) in long - term studies has just started to emerge with regard to the gastrointestinal tract . also , interactions between the microbiota and the host are being considered pivotal in the early programming of gut functions . finally , suggestions for future research are provided in order to better understand and then control early programming as an attempt to optimize vital functions of the gastrointestinal tract throughout adult life .	1
human endometrial cell coculture reduces the endocrine disruptor toxicity on mouse embryo development .. unlabelled : backgrounds : previous studies suggested that endocrine disruptors ( ed ) are toxic on preimplantation embryos and inhibit development of embryos in vitro culture . however , information about the toxicity of endocrine disruptors on preimplantation development of embryo in human reproductive environment is lacking . methods : bisphenol a ( bpa ) and aroclor 1254 ( polychlorinated biphenyls ) were used as endocrine disruptors in this study . mouse 2 - cell embryos were cultured in medium alone or vehicle or co - cultured with human endometrial epithelial layers in increasing ed concentrations . results : at 72 hours the percentage of normal blastocyst were decreased by ed in a dose - dependent manner while the co - culture system significantly enhanced the rate and reduced the toxicity of endocrine disruptors on the embryonic development in vitro . conclusions : in conclusion , although eds have the toxic effect on embryo development , the co - culture with human endometrial cell reduced the preimplantation embryo from it thereby making human reproductive environment protective to preimplantation embryo from the toxicity of endocrine disruptors .	0
benzoyl germanium derivatives as novel visible light photoinitiators for dental materials .. objectives : the objective of this study was to investigate the use of benzoyl germanium derivatives as a novel visible light photoinitiator of resin - based dental composites . selected mechanical properties , such as flexural strength and flexural modulus , setting time , storage stability , and uv light stability , of the composites based on the novel photoinitiators benzoyltrimethylgermane ( btmge ) or dibenzoyldiethylgermane ( dbdege ) were investigated and compared to the properties of materials that are cured with a mixture of camphorquinone ( cq ) and ethyl 4 -( n , n - dimethylamino ) benzoate ( embo ). methods : the flexural strength and flexural modulus of elasticity were determined according to iso 4049 . for this purpose , test specimens ( 2 mm x 2 mm x 25 mm ) of the composites investigated were prepared in stainless steel moulds and light - cured ( 150 mw / cm2 , 2 s x 180 s ). the flexural strength and flexural modulus of elasticity were measured after immersing the cured specimens in water for 24h at 37 degrees c and in certain cases , after they had been boiled for 24h in water . in addition , the setting time , curing depth , storage and uv stability of selected composites were determined . results : the novel photoinitiators btmge or dbdege can be used to substitute the binary photoinitiator cq / embo in visible light - cured restorative composites . especially , dbdege showed a significantly higher photocuring activity in composites with a filler load of about 60 wt . % in comparison to that of cq / embo . in addition , composites based on btmge or dbdege showed an improved uv stability and a storage stability comparable to that of cq / embo - based composites .	0
an evaluation on combination effects of phenolic endocrine disruptors by estrogen receptor binding assay .. phenolic compounds are widely distributed in the natural environment , typically existing as a mixture at the nanomole or micromole per liter level . among the phenolic compounds , 4 - nonylphenol , 4 - t - octylphenol , bisphenol a and 2 , 4 - dichlorophenol attract the most concern due to their abundance and risks in the natural environment . the former three are known as endocrine disruptors causing feminization in various organisms , whereas the latter requires further clarification for its estrogenic effect . this study aims to evaluate the combination effects of these chemicals with estrogen receptor binding as an endpoint . an elisa based receptor binding assay was employed to avoid radioactive pollution in the traditional assay . the results showed that all these chemicals could bind with estrogen receptor with a relative binding affinity of bisphenol a > 4 - t - octylphenol > 4 - nonylphenol > 2 , 4 - dichlorophenol . the four chemicals were further mixed in two ways , at an equipotent ratio and at an equal environmental level ratio , and their combination effects on receptor binding were evaluated with both the toxicity units method and concentration addition model . the resulting effects of both mixtures showed an antagonistic mode , which was assumed to be a general mode of action with estrogen receptor binding assay due to competitive ligand binding on receptors .	0

survey monitoring results on the reduction of micropollutants , bacteria , bacteriophages and tss in retention soil filters .. a main source of surface water pollution in western europe stems from combined sewer overflow . one of the few technologies available to reduce this pollution is the retention soil filter . in this research project , we evaluated the cleaning efficiency of retention soil filters measuring the concentration ratio of standard wastewater parameters and bacteria according to factors limiting efficiency , such as long dry phases or phases of long - lasting retention . furthermore , we conducted an initial investigation on how well retention soil filters reduce certain micropollutants on large - scale plants . there was little precipitation during the 1 - year sampling phase , which led to fewer samples than expected . nevertheless , we could verify how efficiently retention soil filters clean total suspended solids . our results show that retention soil filters are not only able to eliminate bacteria , but also to retain some of the micropollutants investigated here . as the filters were able to reduce diclofenac , bisphenol a and metoprolol by a median rate of almost 75 %, we think that further investigations should be made into the reduction processes in the filter . at this point , a higher accuracy in the results could be achieved by conducting bench - scale experiments .	0
effects of bisphenol a on adipokine release from human adipose tissue : implications for the metabolic syndrome .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is one of the most prevalent and best studied endocrine disruptors . after years of exposure to consumer products containing bpa , most individuals tested have circulating bpa at the low nanomolar levels . in addition to its well documented actions on the reproductive system , bpa exerts a wide variety of metabolic effects . this review summarizes recent findings on the ability of bpa , at environmentally relevant doses , to inhibit adiponectin and stimulate the release of inflammatory adipokines such as interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnfalpha ) from human adipose tissue . expression of several classical and non - classical estrogen receptors in human adipose tissue raises the possibility of their involvement as mediators of bpa actions . the implications of these observations to the obesity - related metabolic syndrome and its sequelae are discussed .	1
photodegradation of bisphenol - a in a batch tio2 suspension reactor .. in this work , the photocatalytic behaviors of bisphenol - a ( bpa ), which has been listed as one of endocrine disrupting chemicals , were carried out in a batch tio ( 2 ) suspension reactor . the photodegradation efficiency has been investigated under the controlled process parameters including initial bpa concentration ( i . e ., 1 - 50 mg l (- 1 )), tio ( 2 ) dosage ( i . e ., 5 - 600 mg / 200 cm ( 3 )), initial ph ( i . e ., 3 - 11 ), and temperature ( i . e ., 10 - 70 degrees c ). it was found that the optimal conditions in the photoreaction process could be coped with at initial bpa concentration = 20 mg l (- 1 ), tio ( 2 ) dosage = 0 . 5 g l (- 1 ) ( 100mg / 200 cm ( 3 )), initial ph = 7 . 0 , and temperature = 25 degrees c . according to the langmuir - hinshelwood model , the results showed that the photodegradation kinetics for the destruction of bpa in water also followed the first - order model well . the apparent first - order reaction constants ( k ( obs )), thus obtained from the fittings of the model , were in line with the destruction - removal efficiencies of bpa in all the photocatalytic experiments . based on the intermediate products identified in the study , the possible mechanisms for the photodegradation of bpa in water were also proposed in the present study .	0
the pancreatic beta - cell as a target of estrogens and xenoestrogens : implications for blood glucose homeostasis and diabetes .. the estrogen receptor eralpha is emerging as a key molecule involved in glucose and lipid metabolism . the main functions of pancreatic beta - cells are the biosynthesis and release of insulin , the only hormone that can directly decrease blood glucose levels . estrogen receptors eralpha and erbeta exist in beta - cells . the role of erbeta is still unknown , yet eralpha plays an important role in the regulation of insulin biosynthesis , insulin secretion and beta - cell survival . activation of eralpha by 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) and the environmental estrogen bisphenol - a ( bpa ) promotes an increase of insulin biosynthesis through a non - classical estrogen - activated pathway that involves phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 . the activation of eralpha by physiological concentrations of e2 may play an important role in the adaptation of the endocrine pancreas to pregnancy . however , if eralpha is over stimulated by an excess of e2 or the action of an environmental estrogen such as bpa , it will produce an excessive insulin signaling . this may provoke insulin resistance in the liver and muscle , as well as beta - cell exhaustion and therefore , it may contribute to the development of type ii diabetes .	0
the use of toxicodynamics in risk assessment .. risk assessment of xenobiotics is a qualitative and quantitative assessment of toxic properties conventionally based on data resulting from tests in animals exposed to the substance . the assessment of dose - effect relationship includes evaluation of exposure at the site of action . more recently , emphasis is put on understanding the relationship between exposure at the site of action and the resulting effect , i . e . toxicodynamic . in this respect , results from genotoxicity studies may be a measure for exposure and at the same time of an effect . results of toxicodynamic endpoints such as binding to receptors or release of hormones have been used when replacing default values for interspecies extrapolation . it may also be envisaged to use toxicodynamic endpoints in order to get an estimate of intraspecies variability . it was demonstrated that this approach may be helpful only if the relationship between the toxicodynamic endpoint and the definite endpoint is known by using the example of bisphenol a . whereas there are clear effects of bisphenol a in in vitro and ex vivo studies , the classical two generation study has not been able to detect an effect on reproduction and / or fertility . looking in the future development of toxicodynamic endpoints , gene profiling and the analysis of proteins (' proteomics ') may be helpful tools employed in screening and being related to the mode of action are explored for their suitability in terms of toxicodynamic endpoints .	0
cdna microarray analysis reveals chop - 10 plays a key role in sertoli cell injury induced by bisphenol a .. we examined the time course of changes in gene expression in detail using cdna microarray analysis of mouse sertoli tte3 cells treated with bisphenol a ( bpa ). a subtoxic dose of bpa ( 200 microm ) transiently increased intracellular ca ( 2 +) concentration and time - dependently induced an increase in mrna level of 78 - kda glucose - regulated protein , indicating that bpa induces endoplasmic reticulum stress . of the 865 genes analyzed , 31 genes showed increased levels of expression . taqman analysis confirmed that the mrna levels of chop - 10 , fra - 2 , c - myc , and ornithine decarboxylase were increased , and showed that chop - 10 is the most sensitive gene . the expression level of chop - 10 protein and cell injury induced by bpa were significantly reduced in stable tte3 cells overexpressing full - length chop - 10 antisense rna . we conclude that chop - 10 plays a key role in sertoli cell injury induced by bpa .	0

analysis of reaction products of food contaminants and ingredients : bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) in canned foods .. bisphenol a diglycidyl ether ( badge ) is an epoxide that is used as a starting substance in the manufacture of can coatings for food - contact applications . following migration from the can coating into food , badge levels decay and new reaction products are formed by reaction with food ingredients . the significant decay of badge was demonstrated by liquid chromatographic ( lc ) analysis of foodstuffs , that is , tuna , apple puree , and beer , spiked with badge before processing and storage . life - science inspired analytical approaches were successfully applied to study the reactions of badge with food ingredients , for example , amino acids and sugars . an improved mass balance of badge was achieved by selective detection of reaction products of badge with low molecular weight food components , using a successful combination of stable isotopes of badge and analysis by lc coupled to fluorescence detection ( fld ) and high - resolution mass spectrometric ( ms ) detection . furthermore , proteomics approaches showed that badge also reacts with peptides ( from protein digests in model systems ) and with proteins in foods . the predominant reaction center for amino acids , peptides , and proteins was cysteine .	0
bisphenol a effect on glutathione synthesis and recycling in testicular sertoli cells .. background and objective : controversial effects of bisphenol a ( bpa ) have been reported on testicular function . these differences might reflect dissimilar exposure conditions . dose responses to toxicants may be non - linear , e . g . u - shaped , with effects at low and at high levels of exposure and lower or inexistent effects at intermediate levels . sertoli cells produce high levels of glutathione ( gsh ) as a cell defense mechanism . in this study , we addressed the question whether the exposure to different doses of bpa could influence sertoli cell gsh synthesis and recycling . materials and methods : primary sertoli cell cultures were exposed to various doses of bpa ( 0 . 5 nm - 100 μm ). cell viability was measured as an outcome of toxic effect . gsh cell content was determined to evaluate cell response to toxicant exposure . glutamate - cysteine ligase catalytic ( gclc ) and modulatory ( gclm ) subunit expression were assessed to estimate gsh synthesis , and gsh reductase ( gr ) expression to estimate gsh recycling . results : bpa 100 μm , but not lower doses , decreased cell viability . bpa 10 and 50 μm , but not lower doses , induced an increment in sertoli cell gsh levels , due to a rapid upregulation of gclc and gr and a slower upregulation of gclm . conclusions : high doses of bpa are deleterious for sertoli cells . intermediate doses do not affect sertoli cell viability and increase cell content of gsh owing to increased gsh synthesis and recycling enzyme expression . lower doses of bpa are not capable of eliciting a cell defense response . these observations may explain a non - linear dose response of sertoli cells to bpa .	0

influence of ceramic thickness and curing mode on the polymerization shrinkage kinetics of dual - cured resin cements .. objectives : the purpose of this study was to assess how ceramic disc thickness and curing mode ( light or chemical ) affects the polymerization shrinkage of dual - cured resin cements and to evaluate the effect of the ceramic discs on the curing speed of the cements during light exposure . methods : six commercial resin cements , relyx arc , bistite ii , duolink , panavia f , variolink ii and choice were used . filler weight contents were determined by the ash method . four ceramic discs with thicknesses of 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 and 4mm , respectively , were made . the attenuation of light intensity due to the ceramic discs was measured using a radiometer . the polymerization shrinkage kinetics of the resin cements by chemical or light cure through the different ceramic discs was measured using a bonded - disc method . results : there were differences in filler content among brands of resin cement . the polymerization shrinkage without ceramic disc was 2 . 61 - 4 . 59 % by chemical cure and 2 . 93 - 4 . 66 % by light cure . the polymerization shrinkage of relyx arc and panavia f by chemical cure was statistically lower than by light cure ( p < 0 . 05 ). polymerization shrinkage and filler weight were inversely related ( r =- 0 . 965 ). both the transmitted light intensity and polymerization shrinkage decreased with increasing thickness of ceramic discs ( p < 0 . 05 ). the time to reach the maximum shrinkage rate of the resin cements increased with increasing ceramic thickness . the cure speed by light cure was 15 - 322 times faster than by chemical cure . significance : the polymerization shrinkage kinetics of dual - cured resin cements significantly differed between brands under various curing conditions . clinicians should be aware of the setting characteristics of the cements , so they can choose the optimal materials for different clinical situations .	0
proteomic analysis in mammary glands of rat offspring exposed in utero to bisphenol a .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant with established endocrine disruptor properties . the objective of our study was to determine the effects of prenatal exposure to bpa on the rat mammary gland proteome in postnatal rats as a first step toward the investigation of translational biomarkers of susceptibility in the human population . pregnant rats were treated orally with 0 , 25 or 250 microg bpa / kg body weight from days 10 to 21 post - conception . female offspring were euthanized at 21 and 50 days , and mammary glands were collected . proteomic analysis was conducted using 2 - de , followed by a combination of maldi - tof - tof and lc - ms / ms , which led to the identification of 21 differentially abundant proteins including vimentin , sparc and 14 - 3 - 3 . western blot analysis of key downstream signaling proteins demonstrated increased phospho - akt , c - raf , phospho - erks - 1 and 2 , but decreased tgf - beta in mammary glands of 50 day old rats exposed prenatally to bpa . our studies indicate for the first time that key proteins involved in signaling pathways such as cellular proliferation are regulated at the protein level by bpa . this data is expected to aid in the understanding of how bpa may be influencing the susceptibility of the mammary gland to cancer transformation .	0
developmental exposure to bisphenol a leads to cardiometabolic dysfunction in adult mouse offspring .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a chemical compound that has adverse health outcomes in adults when exposed during the perinatal period . however , its effect on cardiovascular function remains to be elucidated . in this study , we examined the effects of daily administration of bpa to pregnant mice from gestational days 11 to 19 on cardiometabolic outcomes in the adult offspring . prenatal bpa exposure resulted in altered growth trajectory and organ size , increase adiposity and impaired glucose homeostasis in male and female offspring . in addition , these bpa offspring exhibited raised systolic blood pressure , and in the males this was accompanied by impaired vascular tone . the aortas in females , but not in males , from the bpa group also showed reduced estrogen receptor gene expression . these results indicate that prenatal exposure to bpa increased susceptibility of the offspring to developing cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction later in life .	0
influence of different adhesive systems on the pull - out bond strength of glass fiber posts .. this in vitro study evaluated the tensile bond strength of glass fiber posts ( reforpost - angelus - brazil ) cemented to root dentin with a resin cement ( relyx arc - 3m / espe ) associated with two different adhesive systems ( adper single bond - 3m / espe and adper scotchbond multi purpose ( mp ) plus - 3m / espe ), using the pull - out test . twenty single - rooted human teeth with standardized root canals were randomly assigned to 2 groups ( n = 10 ): g1 - etching with 37 % phosphoric acid gel ( 3m / espe ) + adper single bond + # 1 post ( reforpost - angelus ) + four # 1 accessory posts ( reforpin - angelus ) + resin cement ; g2 - etching with 37 % phosphoric acid gel + adper scotchbond mp plus + # 1 post + four # 1 accessory posts + resin cement . the specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees c for 7 days and submitted to the pull - out test in a universal testing machine ( emic ) at a crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / min . the mean values of bond strength ( kgf ) and standard deviation were : g1 - 29 . 163 +/- 7 . 123 ; g2 - 37 . 752 +/- 13 . 054 . statistical analysis ( student ' s t - test ; a = 0 . 05 showed no statistically significant difference ( p < 0 . 05 ) between the groups . adhesive bonding failures between resin cement and root canal dentin surface were observed in both groups , with non - polymerized resin cement in the apical portion of the post space when single bond was used ( g1 ). the type of adhesive system employed on the fiber post cementation did not influence the pull - out bond strength .	0
occupational exposure to epoxy resins has no cytogenetic effect .. cytogenetic evaluation was performed of peripheral lymphocytes from 18 workers currently exposed to epoxy resins of the type diglycidyl ether bisphenol - a ( dgeba ). 9 workers were exposed to low molecular ( average mw less than 900 ) and 9 to high molecular ( average mw about 2000 ) epoxy resins . the results were compared with an equal number of control individuals matched for sex and age . there was no difference in chromosomal aberration frequency between the controls and the groups exposed to epoxy resin . thus , this study gave no indication that exposure to epoxy resin produces visible damage to the chromosomes .	0
a clinical trial of a light activated bonding material over an 18 month period .. heliosit - orthodontic , a visible light cured adhesive , has been compared with right - on , a chemically activated adhesive , on 122 patients for a mean period of 12 months with a range 3 - 18 months . the overall bond failure rate was 20 per cent . heliosit - orthodontic had a 23 per cent failure rate compared with a 16 per cent failure rate for right - on . heliosit - orthodontic performed less well on the posterior teeth particularly lower second premolars ( p less than 0 . 01 ). both materials performed equally well in the labial segment .	0
bisphenol a ( bpa ) in u . s . food .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a chemical used for lining metal cans and in polycarbonate plastics , such as baby bottles . in rodents , bpa is associated with early sexual maturation , altered behavior , and effects on prostate and mammary glands . in humans , bpa is associated with cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and male sexual dysfunction in exposed workers . food is a major exposure source . we know of no studies reporting bpa in u . s . fresh food , canned food , and food in plastic packaging in peer reviewed journals . we measured bpa levels in 105 fresh and canned foods , foods sold in plastic packaging , and in cat and dog foods in cans and plastic packaging . we detected bpa in 63 of 105 samples , including fresh turkey , canned green beans , and canned infant formula . ninety - three of these samples were triplicates which had similar detected levels . detected levels ranged from 0 . 23 to 65 . 0 ng / g ww and were not associated with type of food or packaging but did vary with ph . bpa levels were higher for foods of ph 5 compared to more acidic and alkaline foods . detected levels were comparable to those found by others . further research is indicated to determine bpa levels in u . s . food in larger , representative sampling .	0
sequence - specific dna damage by reactive oxygen species : implications for carcinogenesis and aging .. reactive oxygen species ( ros ) generated by environmental chemicals can cause sequence - specific dna damage , which may lead to carcinogenesis and aging . we investigated the mechanism of dna damage by environmental chemicals ( catechol , propyl gallate and bisphenol - a ), homocysteine and uva radiation using human cultured cell lines and ( 32 ) p - labeled dna fragments . carcinogenic catechol induced piperidine - labile sites frequently at thymine residues in the presence of cu ( ii ) and nadh . furthermore , catechol increased the formation of 8 - oxo - 7 , 8 - dihydro - 2 '- deoxyguanosine ( 8 - oxodg ), a characteristic oxidative dna lesion , in human leukemia cell line hl - 60 , but not in hp100 , a hydrogen peroxide ( h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ))- resistant cell line derived from hl - 60 . thus , it is concluded that oxidative dna damage through generation of h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) plays an important role in the carcinogenic process of catechol . in addition , an environmental factor , bisphenol - a , and a dietary factor , propyl , gallate , also induced sequence - specific dna damage via ros generation . uva , as well as uvb , contributes to photoaging . in humans , telomere shortening is believed to be associated with cell senescence . in this study , we investigated the shortening rate of telomeres in human wi - 38 fibroblasts exposed to uva irradiation . the telomere length ( as measured by terminal restriction fragment length ) in wi - 38 fibroblasts irradiated with uva decreased with increasing the irradiation dose . uva irradiation with riboflavin caused damage specifically at the ggg sequence in the dna fragments containing telomere sequence ( ttaggg )( 4 ). we concluded that the ggg - specific damage in telomere sequence induced by uva irradiation participates in the increase of the telomere shortening rate . in this report , we show our experimental results and discuss the mechanisms of sequence - specific dna damage in relation to carcinogenesis and aging .	0

color stability of provisional restorative materials after accelerated aging .. purpose : color of 11 provisional restorative materials ( 4 acrylic resins and 7 resin composites ) was evaluated by reflection spectrophotometry immediately after fabrication , after aging for 15 kj / m ( 2 ), and after aging for 60 kj / m ( 2 ) to determine relative color stability under experimental aging conditions . materials and methods : specimens of provisional restorative materials were polymerized according to manufacturers ' instructions and aged in an artificial aging chamber with exposure to a total ultraviolet irradiation of 60 kj / m ( 2 ) in increments of 15 kj / m ( 2 ). color was measured by cie l * a * b * on a reflection spectrophotometer before and after aging . color change ( delta e *) was calculated and analyzed statistically by analysis of variance with repeated measures after 15 and 60 kj / m ( 2 ) intervals of aging . results : statistically significant changes in color were observed after accelerated aging at both the initial and final aging intervals . five of the 11 provisional materials tested showed perceptible color change ( delta e * from 3 . 6 to 9 . 3 ) after accelerated aging of 15 kj / m ( 2 ). seven of the 11 provisional materials tested showed perceptible color change ( delta e * from 3 . 4 to 9 . 4 ) after accelerated aging of 60 kj / m ( 2 ). conclusions : clinically perceptible color changes ( delta e * delta 3 . 3 ) can be expected in some acrylic resin and composite resin provisional materials after accelerated aging .	0
effects of bisphenol a on fecundity , egg hatchability , and juvenile growth of marisa cornuarietis .. recent work on the snail marisa cornuarietis has claimed to show endocrine disruption in response to bisphenol a ( bpa ). the present experimental design was optimized to detect effects of bpa on fecundity , egg hatchability , and juvenile growth , with an emphasis on reproduction , since previous studies suggested this to be a sensitive endpoint . no differences in eggs / female / month between unexposed snails and snails exposed to nominal concentrations of 0 . 1 , 1 , 25 , and 640 microg bpa / l during six months of exposure were found . no effect of bpa on the percentage of eggs hatching successfully was found , as was no difference in time to hatching between the control and any bpa treatment . we observed a significant decrease in female growth and a marginal effect on female wet weight in the 640 - microg / l treatment compared to the control and a significant increase in male growth rate and a marginal increase in male wet weight in the 1 - microg / l treatment compared to the control . however , a much greater proportion of the variability in juvenile growth was explained by variation between pairs and between siblings from the same pair than by bpa treatment . we conclude that effects of bpa in the nominal exposure range 0 . 1 to 640 microg / l ( measured range 0 . 062 - 696 microg / l ) are unlikely to be of significance for field populations of this species . an additional adult fecundity trial at 22 degrees c ( in contrast to all other experiments that were conducted at 25 degrees c ) found no evidence to suggest that snails are more sensitive to bpa at the lower temperature , as has been previously claimed . the present results indicate that the sensitivity of m . cornuarietis to bpa is similar to that of other aquatic invertebrates for which data are available .	0
in vitro comparison of 10 - minute versus 24 - hour shear bond strengths of six dentin bonding systems .. objective : early bond strengths produced by dentin bonding systems should be sufficient to resist the polymerization shrinkage of resin composite . this study compared the 10 - minute and 24 - hour shear bond strengths of six dentin bonding systems : one - step ( os ), permaquik ( pq ), prime & bond 2 . 1 ( pb ), scotchbond multi - purpose ( sbmp ), single bond ( sb ), and tenure quik with fluoride ( tq ). method and materials : each bonding system was used to bond composite to visibly moist dentin at 34 degrees c +/- 2 degrees c . the specimens were debonded at 37 degrees c +/- 1 degree c 10 minutes after the start of light curing of the bonding system , and the results were compared with the 24 - hour bond strengths . the mode of failure was recorded . results : the 10 - minute mean shear bond strengths were : os , 16 . 4 ; pq , 14 . 3 ; sb , 14 . 0 ; pb , 12 . 7 ; tq , 10 . 7 ; and sbmp , 9 . 3 mpa . the 24 - hour mean shear bond strengths were os , 23 . 3 ; pb , 20 . 8 ; sb , 20 . 3 ; pq , 19 . 4 ; tq , 11 . 2 ; and sbmp , 10 . 0 mpa . the 10 - minute mean shear bond strengths of os , pq , pb , and sb bonding systems were significantly less than the 24 - hour values . more dentinal fractures and mixed failures were observed with os , pq , and pb . systems with higher bond strengths had more resin penetration into the lateral dentinal branches . conclusion : the 10 - minute mean shear bond strengths were all less than 17 mpa , and the 10 - minute bond strengths were less than the 24 - hour values .	0
bonding of resin cements to an aluminous ceramic : a new surface treatment .. objectives : the purpose of the work reported here was to develop a surface treatment of an alumina - based ceramic ( in ceram ) that would make reliable bonding to a resin - based luting agent possible . methods : the surface treatment studied was the application of a suspension of a fine - grained , refractory powder , which after drying was sintered to the surface at 960 degrees c . the adherence potential of the surface was determined by measurement of bond energy . results : it was found that the surface treatment , in conjunction with a heat - treated , silane coupling agent , resulted in mean bond energies of 47 (+/- 19 ), 56 (+/- 22 ), and 525 (+/- 116 ) j / m2 for the three resin cements studied . significance : it was concluded that the new surface treatment makes reliable bonding possible , which may allow new indications for this material .	0
shear bond strengths produced by composite and compomer light cured orthodontic adhesives .. objectives : to test the shear bond strengths obtained when orthodontic brackets were bonded ex vivo using a composite resin and a compomer orthodontic adhesive . methods : specimens were tested in a special jig made to fit an instron testing machine . after debonding , the adhesive remaining on bracket bases and enamel surfaces was mapped . results : bond strengths ranged from 8 to 23 mpa with the composite resin producing higher strengths than the compomer for similar combinations of variables . bond strength was increased by longer curing and a longer debond interval and was higher for brackets with mesh bases than undercut bases . more compomer remained on the enamel surface after debonding than did the composite resin . conclusion : the compomer produced bond strengths within the range considered to be clinically acceptable in other studies . if it was clinically successful as an orthodontic adhesive a compomer would confer the advantage that fluoride release would help to minimize the onset of early caries around bonded brackets .	0
effects of bisphenol a on breast cancer and its risk factors .. the incidence of breast cancer in korea has been increasing for the last two decades ( 1983 - 2005 ), and now , breast cancer is ranked the leading cause of cancer in korean women . along with other endocrine disrupting chemicals ( edcs ), bisphenol a ( bpa ) has been suspected as a potential risk factor for breast cancer . we studied potential associations between bpa exposure and breast cancer risks in korean women by performing biomonitoring of bpa among breast cancer patients and controls ( n = 167 ). blood samples were collected between 1994 and 1997 and kept over 10 years in a freezer under well controlled conditions . the blood bpa levels determined by hplc / fd , ranged between lod ( 0 . 012 microg / l ) and 13 . 87 microg / l ( mean +/- sd , 1 . 69 +/- 2 . 57 microg / l ; median , 0 . 043 microg / l ). in age - matched subjects ( n = 152 ), there were some associations between bpa levels and risks of breast cancer , such as age at first birth and null parity . however , there were no significant differences in blood bpa levels between the cases and the controls ( p = 0 . 42 ). considering interactions between bpa exposure and risks of breast cancer , we suggest further enlarged biomonitoring studies of bpa to provide effective prevention against breast cancer .	0
an integrated assessment of estrogenic contamination and feminization risk in fish in taihu lake , china .. an integrated approach , combining biological and chemical methods , was used to assess potential exposure to exogenous estrogens and their possible interference with the endocrine system of male goldfish ( carassius auratus ) in taihu lake . a suite of biomarkers in caged fish after in situ exposure for 28 days , coupled with six selected exogenous estrogens in water , were determined at eight biomonitoring stations . the compounds estrone , 17β - estradiol ( e2 ), estriol , 17α - ethinylestradiol ( ee2 ), bisphenol - a and diethylstilbestrol were detected in most of the samples and the concentrations of total estradiol equivalent ( eeq ) ranged between 5 . 69 and 17 . 8 ng / l . e2 and ee2 were thought to be the major causal agents responsible for the estrogenic activities . elevated serum vitellogenin and e2 , gonadal dna damage and reduced gonadosomatic index were observed in fish collected from most stations . the integrated biomarker response ( ibr ) index showed good agreement with the observed total eeq levels in water , and feminization risk in fish may be present in northern taihu lake , especially in meiliang bay and zhushan bay .	0

in vitro peel / shear bond strength of orthodontic adhesives .. objectives : the purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro peel / shear bond strength of a selection of orthodontic bracket adhesives to human premolar teeth . methods : twenty - two commercially available bracket adhesives were used to bond the same bracket type ( miniature twin , 3m unitek , monrovia , ca . usa ) on 264 intact human premolar teeth and then adhesively tested to failure . peel / shear bond strength values were calculated in newtons and megapascals . the site of bond failure was scored according to the adhesive remnant index . statistics included one - way analysis of variance and tukey ' s studentized range test together with weibull analysis . the latter is a survival analysis able to describe the performance of a material . results : the mean bond strengths varied from 9 . 9 mpa for concise to 4 . 1 mpa for heliosit orthodontic . the overall f - test showed a significant difference ( p < 0 . 0001 ). no significant differences in bond strength were found between concise , accubond , imperva dual , transbond xt , kurasper and spectrum . conclusion : concise and accubond are among the materials of choice for bonding fixed orthodontic appliances to teeth . these materials combine high bond strength with a reliable bond that is easily and quickly debonded .	0
nonylphenol induces the death of neural stem cells due to activation of the caspase cascade and regulation of the cell cycle .. endocrine disruptors ( eds ) are a great concern throughout the world , because they have adverse effects on human health and wildlife . in the present study , we investigated the effects of eds on the proliferation and survival of murine neural stem cells ( nscs ). in contrast to bisphenol a , phthalic acid benzyl n - butyl ester , phthalic acid di - n - butyl ester and phthalic acid di ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) ester , the treatment of nscs with 4 - nonylphenol for 24 h inhibited cell growth in a concentration - dependent manner . in addition , treatment with 4 - nonylphenol resulted in nuclear condensation and dna fragmentation ( morphological changes due to apoptosis ) in nscs after 12 h of exposure , and activated caspase - 3 after 6 h and 9 h of exposure . furthermore , an exposure to 4 - nonylphenol led to the accumulation of cells at the g2 / m phase interface and down - regulated the protein levels of cyclin a and b1 , which are the major regulatory proteins at the g2 to m transition of the cell cycle . together , these results indicate that , in contrast to other eds , 4 - nonylphenol may exhibit a potent cytotoxicity through apoptosis via the caspase cascade and cell cycle arrest at the g2 / m phase , and suggest that 4 - nonylphenol may affect neurogenesis in the cns .	0
concentration and temperature dependence of diluent dynamics studied by line shape experiments on a phosphate ester in polycarbonate .. 31p hahn spin echo line shape and proton line shape experiments are reported on bisphenol a polycarbonate ( bpapc )- tris ( 2 - ethylehexyl ) phosphate ( top ) systems to study the concentration and temperature dependence of the local dynamics . in an earlier 31p line shape study a lattice model was presented as a framework to interpret the plasticization and antiplasticization behavior of the diluent based on a fractional population given by the type of nearest neighbor contacts in the mixed polymer - diluent glass . in this study , 31p spin echo line shapes of bpapc , with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % top , which monitor the diluent dynamics , at different temperatures and echo delay times are simulated in terms of fast - and slow - moving components , and the resulting fractional populations are compared with that predicted by the lattice model . comparisons with the lattice model calculations are also made in the simulation of the 1h line shapes on bpapc with 5 % and 10 % top , which probes both the polymer and diluent dynamics , and on bpapc with 5 % and 10 % perdeuterated trioctylphosphate ( dtop ), which detects only the polymer motion . fairly good line shape simulations and agreement between the lattice model and the fitting results at low diluent concentrations are obtained in all cases . restricted cone motion best describes the slow - moving component in the 31p line shape fittings . for the fast component , rotational brownian diffusion with a distribution of correlation times corresponding to a stretched exponential function is used . an activation energy ea of 56 kj / mol and an exponent alpha of 0 . 7 for the fractional exponential correlation function are obtained and used to calculate the mechanical loss peak which was compared with the experimental loss data . the plateau character of the fractional population as a function of temperature can also be interpreted and understood in terms of the lattice model .	0
the estrogenic content of rodent diets , bedding , cages , and water bottles and its effect on bisphenol a studies .. the lowest observed adverse effect level for bisphenol a ( bpa ) in mice and rats is currently poorly defined due to inconsistent study designs and results in published studies . the objectives of the current study were to ( 1 ) compare the estrogenic content of rodent diets , bedding , cages , and water bottles to evaluate their impact on the estrogenic activity of bpa and ( 2 ) review the literature on bpa to determine the most frequently reported diets , beddings , cages , and water bottles used in animal studies . our literature review indicated that low - dose bpa animal studies have inconsistent results and that factors contributing to this inconsistency are the uses of high - phytoestrogen diets and the different routes of exposure . in 44 % ( 76 of 172 ) of all reports , rodents were exposed to bpa via the subcutaneous route . our literature review further indicated that the type of diet , bedding , caging , and water bottles used in bpa studies were not always reported . only 37 % ( 64 of 172 ) of the reports described the diet used . in light of these findings , we recommend the use of a diet containing low levels of phytoestrogen ( less than 20 μg / g diet ) and metabolizable energy ( approximately 3 . 1 kcal / g diet ) and estrogen - free bedding , cages , and water bottles for studies evaluating the estrogenic activity of endocrine - disrupting compounds such as bpa . the oral route of bpa exposure should be used when results are to be extrapolated to humans .	0
epigenetic influences of low - dose bisphenol a in primary human breast epithelial cells .. substantial evidence indicates that exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) during early development may increase breast cancer risk later in life . the changes may persist into puberty and adulthood , suggesting an epigenetic process being imposed in differentiated breast epithelial cells . the molecular mechanisms by which early memory of bpa exposure is imprinted in breast progenitor cells and then passed onto their epithelial progeny are not well understood . the aim of this study was to examine epigenetic changes in breast epithelial cells treated with low - dose bpa . we also investigated the effect of bpa on the erα signaling pathway and global gene expression profiles . compared to control cells , nuclear internalization of erα was observed in epithelial cells preexposed to bpa . we identified 170 genes with similar expression changes in response to bpa . functional analysis confirms that gene suppression was mediated in part through an erα - dependent pathway . as a result of exposure to bpa or other estrogen - like chemicals , the expression of lysosomal - associated membrane protein 3 ( lamp3 ) became epigenetically silenced in breast epithelial cells . furthermore , increased dna methylation in the lamp3 cpg island was this repressive mark preferentially occurred in erα - positive breast tumors . these results suggest that the in vitro system developed in our laboratory is a valuable tool for exposure studies of bpa and other xenoestrogens in human cells . individual and geographical differences may contribute to altered patterns of gene expression and dna methylation in susceptible loci . combination of our exposure model with epigenetic analysis and other biochemical assays can give insight into the heritable effect of low - dose bpa in human cells .	0
effects of gamma radiation on the in vitro wear of composite restorative materials .. the effects of gamma radiation at therapeutic dosage levels on the wear of three anterior ( two light - cured and one autocured ) composites and a light - cured posterior composite were studied in vitro . specimens were subjected to successive sets of 100 abrades to a maximum of 500 abrades on a reciprocating arm abrader , with the dimensional change being recorded between the sets of abrades . the data showed that there were no significant effects on the wear rates of any of the materials tested . the rate of height loss was similar for the two hybrid composites tested ( p less than 0 . 05 ), as was that for the microfilled and conventional material ( p less than 0 . 05 ). there was , however , a significant difference ( p greater than 0 . 001 ) in the wear behaviour between the two groups .	0
orally administered bisphenol a disturbed antigen specific immunoresponses in the naïve condition .. bisphenol a [ 2 , 2 - bis ( 4 - hydoxyphenyl ) propane ; bpa ] is an endocrine disrupter widely used in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins . we investigated the effects of orally administered bpa on antigen - specific responses of the naïve immune system . bpa was orally administered to t cell receptor transgenic mice , and the antigen - specific responses of immune cells were investigated . administered bpa moderately reduced interleukin ( il )- 2 , 4 , and interferon ( ifn )- gamma secretion and increases in iga and igg2a production . additionally , it was found that orally administered bpa increased antigen - specific ifn - gamma production of t cells and modified whole antigen presenting cells ( apcs ) to suppress antigen - specific cytokine production from t cells . these findings suggest that bpa can augment the th1 - type responses of naïve immune systems , though the bioavailability of orally administered bpa was low in our experiments .	0
lead and bisphenol a concentrations in the canadian population .. background : lead is a known toxicant that occurs naturally in the environment . bisphenol a ( bpa ) is an industrial chemical used primarily in polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins . it has been 30 years since lead exposure was measured at a national level , and it is the first time for a national assessment of bpa exposure . data and methods : data are from the 2007 - 2009 canadian health measure survey . lead in whole blood ( pbb ) and urinary bpa were measured in 5319 and 5476 respondents aged 6 to 79 , respectively . geometric means ( gms ) are presented by age group and sex for pbb ( pg / dl ), volume - based bpa ( microg / l ), and creatinine - standardized bpa ( microg / g creatinine ). adjusted least squares geometric means ( lsgms ) for pbb and bpa are presented by selected covariates . results : pbb was detected in 100 % of the population , with a gm concentration of 1 . 34 microg / dl . adults aged 60 to 79 and males had significantly higher gm pbb concentrations . lower household income , being born outside canada , living in a dwelling at least 50 years old , current or former smoking , and drinking alcohol at least once a week were associated with higher pbb concentrations . urinary bpa was detected in 91 % of the population , with a gm concentration of 1 . 16 microg / l ( 1 . 40 microg / g creatinine ). children aged 6 to 11 had significantly higher gm creatinine - standardized bpa concentrations than did other age groups . interpretation : although pbb concentrations have declined dramatically since the 1970s , socio - demographic characteristics , the age of dwellings , and certain lifestyle behaviours are associated with higher levels . given the short half - life of orally ingested bpa and the high frequency of detection , the chms data suggest continual widespread exposure in the canadian population .	0
the role of estrogen receptor , androgen receptor and growth factors in diethylstilbestrol - induced programming of prostate differentiation .. recently , others and we have demonstrated that prenatal exposure to an extremely low dose of diethylstilbestrol ( des ) and other estrogenic compounds produces a significant effect on mouse prostate development in vivo and in vitro in the presence and absence of androgen . in this study , we investigated the mechanism by which des produces this effect and determined the role of its estrogenic activity on the growth and branching , induced by des in the 17 - day - old fetal prostate in culture . additionally , we investigated whether the androgen receptor ( ar ) plays a role and whether any of the growth factors , namely , egf and igf - 1 which are known to modulate the estrogen receptor ( er ) and androgen receptor ( ar )- dependent process , mediate the des - induced effects . using the organ culture bioassay of prostate development , we demonstrate that des enhanced the growth and branching of the prostate at both 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 pg / ml dosages , thus , confirming a previous report of ours . an anti - estrogen , ici164 , 387 blocked both of the effect of des , suggesting that both of these two effects are er dependent . anti - androgen , flutamide also blocked both branching and prostatic growth induced by des , while cyproterone acetate blocked only the branching effect , suggesting a role for ar in the des - induced effects . depletion of egf by anti - egf antibody blocked the des - induced effects and this was reversed following egf replacement in the organ culture system . anti - igf - 1 antibody , on the other hand , only blocked the branching effect , but produced no effect on the prostatic growth , induced by des . estrogenic chemicals , bisphenol a and des enhanced egf - mrna level of the cultured prostates . taken together , it appears that des - induced prostatic enlargement involves enhancement of er - dependent egf and igf - 1 synthesis , mediating prostatic enlargement and androgen action .	0
the effect of two polishing pastes on the surface roughness of bis - acryl composite and methacrylate - based resins .. statement of problem : a highly polished restoration surface is necessary to promote a plaque - free environment . purpose : the purpose of this study was to compare the surface roughness of 3 different bis - acryl composite - based and 3 different methyl methacrylate - based provisional crown and fixed partial denture resins after being polished with aluminum oxide and diamond paste . material and methods : six different materials were used ( iso - temp , protemp ii , structer 2 , dentalon plus , tab 2000 kerr , temdent ). a total of 180 specimens were fabricated : 30 specimens of each material using circular stainless steel molds 10 mm in diameter and 2 mm high . each material was mixed and polymerized according to manufacturer ' s instructions . the bis - acryl composite specimens were polymerized with a laboratory light - initiating unit for 30 seconds on each side ( 400 to 525 nm , 75 w quartz - halogen light source ). all specimens were kept in a water bath at 37 degrees c for 45 minutes . ten specimens of each group were left as untreated controls , 10 specimens of each group were polished with the aluminum oxide paste ( composite polish ), and 10 specimens of each group were polished with the diamond paste ( insta glaze ). surface roughness was determined with a profilometer . the data were analyzed with one - way analysis of variance ( post hoc scheffe ' s s test ) ( p <. 001 ). in addition , the profilometric evaluations photographic images were recorded with a scanning electron microscope to examine the surface roughness after polishing . results : the mean of the surface characteristics of the bis - acryl composites were 1 . 33 microm for aluminum oxide and 0 . 90 microm for diamond polishing paste ; the mean of the results of the methyl methacrylate resins were 1 microm for aluminum oxide and 0 . 50 microm for diamond polishing paste . the difference between the mean values of bis - acryl resins groups and methacrylate - based resin groups were significant ( p <. 001 ). the difference between the subgroups of bis - acryl resins group ( iso - temp , protemp ii , structer 2 ) were not significant ( p >. 05 ). the difference between the subgroups of methacrylate - based resin group ( dentalon , tab 2000 , temdent ) were not significant ( p >. 05 ). conclusion : within the limitations of this study , single - phase polishing of the bis - acryl composites tested and the methacrylate resins tested with diamond - based paste produced a smoother surface than when polished with aluminum oxide paste .	0
tobramycin and gentamycin elution analysis between two in situ polymerizable orthopedic composites .. this research analyzed tobramycin and gentamycin elution characteristics for two antibiotic - impregnated bone composites : pmma - based simplex p and the novel , hybrid , bioactive , cortoss . experimental results were correlated with composite hydrophilicity and antibiotic phase partitioning behaviors . the phase partitioning experiment was conducted to understand antibiotic solubility in aqueous environments . by comparing experimental results with calculated data , antibiotic release behavior was predicted . total tobramycin elution percentages from cortoss and simplex p were 12 . 5 and 6 . 4 %, respectively . total gentamycin elution percentages from cortoss and simplex p were 6 . 95 and 10 . 17 %, respectively . phase partitioning data indicate 100 % of tobramycin remains in aqueous phases , being extremely hydrophilic . this is supported by its calculated theoretical value ( log p = - 7 . 32 ). results suggest that tobramycin elution can be attributed to composite hydrophilicity as well as its high degree of hydrophilicity . fifteen percent of gentamycin distributes in hydrophobic phases ( log p = - 4 . 22 ). despite a lower gentamycin hydrophilicity , its release was affected by its complexation with polar salts in the leaching buffer , thereby increasing its elution potential , making it appreciably water soluble . cortoss is more hydrophilic ; therefore the migration of aqueous liquids into the polymer network of cortoss facilitates greater antibiotic elution compared with hydrophobic simplex p .	0
elution of bisphenol - a from hemodialyzers consisting of polycarbonate and polysulfone resins .. this study deals with bisphenol - a ( bpa ) analysis of the bpa - derived polymer pellets , polycarbonate ( pc ) and polysulfone ( ps ), and in the hemodialyzer casings made of pc , and the leaching of bpa from commercially available hemodialyzers into water and bovine serum , using hplc , gc - ms , and lc - ms analyses , and nmr spectroscopy . total contents of bpa in polymer pellets of each resin were 4 . 0 and 7 . 2 microg / g ( pc ) and 34 . 5 microg / g ( ps ). amounts of bpa released from hemodialyzer pc casings lacking ps hollow - fiber were 11 . 7 and 13 . 7 ng / casing by water extraction , and 296 and 345 ng / casing by methanol extraction . on the other hand , bpa of 3 . 78 to 141 . 8 ng / module was recovered using water circulation of hemodialyzers , and 140 . 7 to 2 , 090 ng / module was detected when bovine serum was used as a circulation solvent . the elution profiles using various concentrations of ethanol / water mixtures indicated that a 17 . 2 % ( v / v ) ethanol solution rather than bovine serum can be used as an extraction solvent , where a similar amount of bpa as with bovine serum circulation was eluted from the hemodialyzer . thus , this solvent may be useful for evaluating bpa elution from hemodialyers under similar conditions to medical use .	0
in vitro dentine fluoride uptake from three fluoride - containing composites and their acid resistance .. objectives : the purpose of this study was to determine the dentine fluoride uptake from three fluoride - containing composites ( fluorever , fluorocore and pertac - hybrid ) and to investigate their ability to affect the resistance of dentine to an artificial caries challenge . methods : three dentine slabs were prepared from each tooth . the baseline , total and bound fluoride concentrations of each tooth were determined by three successive abrasion biopsies performed on each slab followed by adjusting to standardized depths of 10 microns . next , dentine slabs ligated with the composites were suspended in synthetic saliva for 1 week . after removal of the composites , these specimens and controls were immersed in an artificial caries medium ( ph 4 . 5 ) for 5 days . each slab was sectioned and analysed by quantitative microradiography . results : the results indicate that dentine acquired significantly different amounts of fluoride from the three composites . the acid resistance of dentine in contact with the composites was also significantly different among the composites and followed the same order as for fluoride uptake . conclusions : dentine fluoride uptake and artificial caries inhibition were significantly greater with fluorever followed by fluorocore and pertac - hybrid .	0
removal of highly polar micropollutants from wastewater by powdered activated carbon .. due to concerns about ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants released from wastewater treatment plants , activated carbon adsorption is one of the few processes to effectively reduce the concentrations of micropollutants in wastewater . although aimed mainly at apolar compounds , polar compounds are also simultaneously removed to a certain extent , which has rarely been studied before . in this study , adsorption isotherm and batch kinetic data were collected with two powdered activated carbons ( pacs ) to assess the removal of the polar pharmaceuticals 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) and cytarabine ( cytr ) from ultrapure water and wastewater treatment plant effluent . at ph 7 . 8 , single - solute adsorption isotherm data for the weak acid 5 - fu and the weak base cytr showed that their adsorption capacities were about 1 order of magnitude lower than those of the less polar endocrine disrupting chemicals bisphenol a ( bpa ) and 17 - α - ethinylestradiol ( ee2 ). to remove 90 % of the adsorbate from a single - solute solution 14 , 18 , 70 , and 87 mg l (- 1 ) of hok super is required for ee2 , bpa , cytr , and 5 - fu , respectively . effects of solution ph , ionic strength , temperature , and effluent organic matter ( efom ) on 5 - fu and cytr adsorption were evaluated for one pac . among the studied factors , the presence of efom had the highest effect , due to a strong competition on 5 - fu and cytr adsorption . adsorption isotherm and kinetic data and their modeling with a homogeneous surface diffusion model showed that removal percentage in the presence of efom was independent on the initial concentration of the ionizable compounds 5 - fu and cytr . these results are similar to neutral organic compounds in the presence of natural organic matter . overall , results showed that pac doses sufficient to remove > 90 % of apolar adsorbates were able to remove no more than 50 % of the polar adsorbates 5 - fu and cytr and that the contact time is a critical parameter .	0
design of a new dental adhesive -- effect of a water - soluble sodium acylphosphine oxide with crown ether on adhesion to dental hard tissues .. the behavior of water - soluble photoinitiators with crown ethers in dental adhesives is unknown . this study investigated the effect of sodium acylphosphine oxide ( apo - na ) with crown ether in a hydrophobic adhesive on adhesion to teeth . sodium 2 , 4 , 6 - trimethylbenzoyl - phenylphosphine oxide ( tmpo - na = apo - na ) was synthesized in 67 . 1 % yield and identified by 1h nmr . apo - na was dissolved in hydrophobic resins in the presence of a crown ether ( ionophore effect ). thirty kinds of experimental single - step adhesives comprising apo - na , ce , bis - gma , 6 - methacryloyloxyhexyl phosphonoacetate ( 6 - mhpa ), and 4 - methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitic acid ( 4 - met ) were thereby prepared . shear bond strength to unetched ground teeth was measured at a crosshead speed of 1 . 0 mm / min , and the data were analyzed by anova . the shear bond strength results of bonding resins containing apo - na with 18 - crown - 6 - ether ( ce - 6 ) were significantly higher than that without ce - 6 ( control ) ( p < 0 . 05 ). higher bond strength values [ for enamel : br24 at 19 . 3 ( 3 . 2 ) mpa ; for dentin : br29 at 20 . 2 ( 4 . 7 ) mpa ] were achieved with the adhesives containing apo - na , ce - 6 , 6 - mhpa , and 4 - met . therefore , it was found that apo - na with ce - 6 contributed to the efficient bonding performance of single - step adhesive to teeth . however , in view of the biosafety hazard posed by crown ethers , the search is still on for reagents that are biologically safer than crown ethers -- but with ionophor effects -- to be used in dental adhesives .	0
morphological analysis of flowable resins after long - term storage or surface polishing with a mini - brush .. this study evaluated the surface roughness and morphological changes of various flowable resins after long - term storage in a phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) or surface polishing with a mini - brush . the tested products were beautifil flow bf02 and bf10 , clearfil majesty lv , filtek supreme xt , and unifil loflo plus . a paste - type resin composite , filtek supreme , was used as a control . the prepared specimens were 10 mm in diameter and 1 mm in height . the standard surfaces were polished with # 600 - 1200 diamond disks and kept in deionized water for 24 hours . surface roughness was detected after storage in pbs ( ph 7 . 4 ) for either 2 weeks or 6 months , or after polishing with a mini - brush . results of this study demonstrated that the surface roughness of the standard specimens had a lower value as compared to those after storage in pbs for 2 weeks and 6 months , or after polishing with a mini - brush .	0
optimizing the concentration of 2 , 4 , 6 - trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide initiator in composite resins in relation to monomer conversion .. the aim of this study was to optimize the concentration of 2 , 4 , 6 - trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide ( lucirin ® tpo ) in unfilled and filled composite resins in relation to the degree of conversion ( dc ). increasing concentrations of lucirin ® tpo between 0 . 05 - 4 . 97 wt % were added to equimolar mixtures of bis - gma / tegdma . filled resins contained 75 wt % fillers . standardized samples were cured using a polywave led light - curing unit ( bluephase ® g2 , ivoclar vivadent ). increased initiator concentrations increased logarithmically the dc of unfilled and filled resins . the dc of unfilled resins was in the range of 73 - 91 % at the top and 63 - 81 % at the bottom surfaces and that of filled resins was in the range of 53 - 81 % at the top and 47 - 70 % at the bottom surfaces . the dc in unfilled and filled resins reached a plateau at 1 . 08 wt % and 1 . 50 wt % lucirin ® tpo , respectively . fillers significantly reduced conversion but had no effect on the logarithmic relationship between initiator concentration and the dc .	0
anxiogenic effects of developmental bisphenol a exposure are associated with gene expression changes in the juvenile rat amygdala and mitigated by soy .. early life exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ), a component of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins , alters sociosexual behavior in numerous species including humans . the present study focused on the ontogeny of these behavioral effects beginning in adolescence and assessed the underlying molecular changes in the amygdala . we also explored the mitigating potential of a soy - rich diet on these endpoints . wistar rats were exposed to bpa via drinking water ( 1 mg / l ) from gestation through puberty , and reared on a soy - based or soy - free diet . a group exposed to ethinyl estradiol ( 50 µg / l ) and a soy - free diet was used as a positive estrogenic control . animals were tested as juveniles or adults for anxiety - like and exploratory behavior . assessment of serum bpa and genistein ( gen ), a soy phytoestrogen , confirmed that internal dose was within a human - relevant range . bpa induced anxiogenic behavior in juveniles and loss of sexual dimorphisms in adult exploratory behavior , but only in the animals reared on the soy - free diet . expression analysis revealed a suite of genes , including a subset known to mediate sociosexual behavior , associated with bpa - induced juvenile anxiety . notably , expression of estrogen receptor beta ( esr2 ) and two melanocortin receptors ( mc3r , mc4r ) were downregulated . collectively , these results show that behavioral impacts of bpa can manifest during adolescence , but wane in adulthood , and may be mitigated by diet . these data also reveal that , because erβ and melanocortin receptors are crucial to their function , oxytocin / vasopressin signaling pathways , which have previously been linked to human affective disorders , may underlie these behavioral outcomes .	0
designed recombinant transcription factor with antibody - variable regions .. many recombinant transcription factors have been invented , but we cannot select a substance used as an inducer . in this study , we have created a novel expression control system in which we can select a substance as an inducer toward which a monoclonal antibody ( mab ) is prepared . the variable region fragments ( fvs ) of the heavy and light chains ( v ( h ) and v ( l )) of the bisphenol a ( bpa )- specific mab bba - 2187 were each fused to the dna - binding domain ( dbd ) of lexa and the transactivation domain ( ad ) of vp16 . the association between the two recombinant proteins in the presence of bpa constituted a functional transcription factor . the recombinant proteins in which the dbd was fused to the n - terminal side of the fv and in which the nuclear localization signal ( nls ) was fused to the n - termini of the construct including the ad highly induced beta - galactosidase ( lacz ) expression in recombinant yeast cells grown with bpa . when the fvs of the polychlorinated biphenyl ( pcb )- specific mab 4444 were used , dbd - nls - v ( h ) and nls - ad - v ( l ) showed significantly increased lacz activity in response to a pcb derivative . the fv transcription factor may be useful in many fields such as gene therapeutics .	0
creep of experimental short fiber - reinforced composite resin .. the purpose of this study was to investigate the reinforcing effect of short e - glass fiber fillers oriented in different directions on composite resin under static and dynamic loading . experimental short fiber - reinforced composite resin ( fc ) was prepared by mixing 22 . 5 wt % of short e - glass fibers , 22 . 5 wt % of resin , and 55 wt % of silane - treated silica fillers . three groups of specimens ( n = 5 ) were tested : fc with isotropic fiber orientation , fc with anisotropic fiber orientation , and particulate - filled composite resin ( pfc ) as a control . time - dependent creep and recovery were recorded . anova revealed that after secondary curing in a vacuum oven and after storage in dry condition for 30 days , fc with isotropic fiber orientation ( 1 . 73 %) exhibited significantly lower static creep value ( p < 0 . 05 ) than pfc ( 2 . 54 %). for the different curing methods and storage conditions evaluated in this study , fc achieved acceptable static and dynamic creep values when compared to pfc .	0
volume of the internal gap formed under composite restorations in vitro .. objectives : the gap that develops at the interface of dentin composite restoration during the polymerization of the resin can be subsequently filled by fluid filtrating from the pulp via the dentinal tubules . this in vitro study was designed to determine the volume of such a gap , at the occlusal floor of class i restoration and as a result of different dentin treatments and restoration procedures . methods : fifty - six human third molars had their pulp chambers first sealed and connected to a hydraulic apparatus permitting microlitre fluid shift recordings . the teeth then received class i cavities of uniform dimensions and were sampled into nine groups for three dentin treatments ( bonding with a dentin bonding agent , lining with a resin modified light - cured glass ionomer , lining with a zinc phosphate cement ) and three restoration procedures ( bulk placement of the composite material , multilayer , indirect inlay ). fluid displacements were recorded during the filling procedures and stopped 30 min after the completion of the restorations . results : dentin bonding agent treated cavities consistently presented the smallest gap volumes , followed by the gi and the znpo4 lined specimen . multilayer and indirect restoration techniques reduced the formation of gaps . conclusions : none of the materials or techniques tested assured a gap - free interface and more effort should be directed at increasing the adhesive and sealing properties of restorative materials to be placed on the dentin .	0
influence of powdered dentin on the shear bond strength of dentin bonding systems .. this study evaluated the effect of different amounts of dentin powder ( dp ) mixed in clearfil se bond ( csb ) or single bond ( sb ) on adhesion to dentin . human third molars ( n = 96 ) were sectioned to expose the mid - coronal dentin and divided into eight experimental groups ( n = 12 per group ), namely , group 1 : csb , group 2 : csb + 1 . 5 mg dp , group 3 : csb + 3 mg dp , group 4 : csb + 4 . 5 mg dp , group 5 : sb , group 6 : sb + 1 . 5 mg dp , group 7 : sb + 3 mg dp , and group 8 : sb + 4 . 5 mg dp . filtek z250 composite was bonded onto dentin , and all specimens were subjected to shear bond strength test at a crosshead speed of 1 mm / min . highest bond strength was obtained in groups 1 , 2 , and 3 ( 15 . 1 , 13 . 5 , and 16 . 4 mpa respectively ; p > 0 . 05 ) and the lowest in groups 6 , 7 , and 8 ( 5 . 5 , 5 . 6 , 4 mpa ; p > 0 . 05 ). dp addition , regardless of amount , adversely affected the bond strength of sb . bond strength of csb was not affected when 1 . 5 or 3 mg of dp was added .	0
interaction between bisphenol derivatives and protein disulphide isomerase ( pdi ) and inhibition of pdi functions : requirement of chemical structure for binding to pdi .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is an endocrine disrupting chemical and several biological effects have been reported . previously , protein disulphide isomerase ( pdi ) was isolated as a target molecule of bisphenol a . in this study , to clarify the effects of bpa on pdi functions , we investigated the relationship between the chemical structure of bpa derivatives and the effects on pdi - mediated isomerase and chaperone activity . we also investigated the effects of changes in the isomerase domain of pdi on the binding of chemicals , using pdi mutants and oxidized or reduced pdi . among six chemicals , only chemicals , which have a phenol group , can bind to pdi and these chemicals also have an inhibitory effect on pdi - mediated isomerase activity . changes in the structure of the pdi isomerase domain did not affect chemical - binding activity . on the other hand , the chemicals used in this study have low effects on chaperone activity of pdi . substitutions in cys residues ( cys398 and cys401 ) of the isomerase active site changed chaperone activity . the present study indicates that phenolic compounds specifically bind to pdi and inhibit isomerase activity . this study provides useful information to predict the biological effects of chemicals and structural studies of pdi containing the function of chemical binding .	0
"""alteration of steroid hormone balance in juvenile turbot ( psetta maxima ) exposed to nonylphenol , bisphenol a , tetrabromodiphenyl ether 47 , diallylphthalate , oil , and oil spiked with alkylphenols .. in recent years , concern has been raised about the ability of some classes of environmental contaminants to disrupt the endocrine system of both humans and wildlife . in this study , juvenile turbots ( psetta maxima ) were exposed under laboratory conditions to selected waterborne contaminants : oil , oil spiked with alkylphenols , bisphenol a , diallylphthalate , tetrabrominated diphenyl ether 47 , and p - nonylphenol as a positive control for """" estrogenic - type """" effects . this work focused on sex steroids , because these hormones play a key role in the reproduction process . analytical procedures , involving the off - line coupling of solid phase extraction and gas chromatography / mass spectrometry , were developed for the determination of 12 endogenous sex steroids levels in fish plasma , bile , and gonads . because of the sexual immaturity of the fish used in this study , however , only six steroids could be detected in juvenile turbots . bisphenol a and p - nonylphenol exhibited the highest potency towards steroids dynamics , lowering the ratio of androgens to estrogens in all three studied matrices . however , these two chemicals had different modes of action , because p - nonylphenol induced a decrease of androstenedione and 11 - ketotestosterone levels , whereas bisphenol a exposure led to an elevation of estrone level . overall , these two chemicals seemingly disrupted the activity of some steroidogenesis enzymes , leading to serious hormonal imbalance in juvenile turbot ."""	0

development of surface coating material for discolored tooth equipped with bleaching effect .. it is attempted to augment a coating resin with a bleaching effect to provide both short - and long - term whitening effects . base resin containing sodium percarbonate ( spc ) effectively bleached bovine teeth discolored by the maillard reaction . spc did not reduce vickers hardness , but hardness in the hybrid material increased . the shear bonding strength of spc - containing resin was low . no inflammation was apparent in hamster cheek pouch mucosa when exposed to spc resin covered with a layer of base resin . h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) was released into buffer from this resin , but when placed onto tooth tissue with a protective layer of base resin , penetration of h ( 2 ) o ( 2 ) into the pulp chamber was undetectable . it is concluded that spc resin equipped with a bleaching aid can be safely used as a coating material for discolored teeth .	0
developmental exposure to endocrine disruptor chemicals alters follicular dynamics and steroid levels in caiman latirostris .. human and wildlife are exposed at critical periods of development to endocrine disruptor chemicals ( edc ) that may be responsible for reproductive disorders . to test the hypothesis that in ovum exposure to edc at a critical period for gonadal organogenesis alters post - hatching folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis in caiman latirostris , we studied the impact of in ovum exposure to 17 beta - estradiol ( e2 ), bisphenol a ( bpa ), endosulfan ( end ) and atrazine ( atz ) on gonadal differentiation , follicular dynamics and circulating levels of steroid hormones in neonatal and juvenile caiman . since c . latirostris is a species with temperature dependent sex determination , eggs were incubated at male ( 33 degrees c ) or female ( 30 degrees c ) producing temperatures and the effect of edc was evaluated . neonatal ovaries exhibited germ cells mainly located in clusters evidencing proliferative activity and type i to iii follicles . juvenile ovaries exhibited germ cells and advanced stages of pre - vitellogenic follicles . prenatal exposure to the highest doses of e2 ( 1 . 4 ppm ) or bpa ( 140 ppm ) overrode male temperature effect on sex determination . neonatal females produced by sex reversion lacked type iii follicles , while females prenatally exposed to the lowest doses of e2 ( 0 . 014 ppm ) and bpa ( 1 . 4 ppm ) or atz ( 0 . 2 ppm ) showed an increase in type iii follicles . juvenile caiman prenatally exposed to e2 or bpa showed an augmented incidence of multioocyte follicles . neonatal female caiman exposed in ovum to e2 or bpa had higher estrogen serum levels whereas exposure to e2 , bpa , atz and end decreased t levels . present data demonstrates that exposure to edc during gonadal organogenesis alters follicular dynamics and steroid levels later in life . these effects might have an impact on caiman fertility .	0
determination of endocrine - disrupting chemicals in the liquid and solid phases of activated sludge by solid phase extraction and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry .. the highly complex matrix of activated sludge in sewage treatment plants ( stps ) makes it difficult to detect endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ) which are usually present at low concentration levels . to date , no literature has reported the concentrations of steroid estrogens in activated sludge in china and very limited data are available worldwide . in this work , a highly selective and sensitive analytical method was developed for simultaneous determination of two classes of edcs , including estrone ( e1 ), 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ), estriol ( e3 ), 17 alpha - ethynylestradiol ( ee2 ), 4 - nonylphenol ( np ) and bisphenol a ( bpa ), in the liquid and solid phases of activated sludge . the procedures for sample preparation , extracts derivatization , and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ) quantification were all optimized to effectively determine target edcs while minimizing matrix interference . the developed method showed good calibration linearity , recovery , precision , and a low limit of quantification ( loq ) for all selected edcs in both liquid and solid phases of activated sludge . it was successfully applied to determine the concentrations of edcs in activated sludge samples from two stps located in beijing and shanghai of china , respectively .	0
determination of bisphenol a in human breast milk by hplc with column - switching and fluorescence detection .. a highly sensitive hplc method was developed for the determination of xenoestrogenic compound , bisphenol a ( bpa ) in human breast milk samples . after a two - step liquid - liquid extraction , bpa was derivatized with fluorescent labeling reagent , 4 -( 4 , 5 - diphenyl - 1h - imidazol - 2 - yl ) benzoyl chloride ( dib - cl ). the excess fluorescent reagent could be removed effectively using a column - switching system . the separation of dib - bpa from endogenous materials in milk was carried out on two c ( 18 ) columns and fluorescence intensity was monitored at 475 nm with the excitation of 350 nm . a good linearity ( r = 0 . 994 ) was observed of bpa in the concentration range of 0 . 2 - 5 . 0 ng ml (- 1 ) in breast milk , and the detection limit was 0 . 11 ng ml (- 1 ) at a signal - to - noise ratio of 3 . intra - and inter - day precision ( rsd , %) were less than 8 . 7 and 10 . 4 , respectively . twenty - three breast milk samples of healthy lactating women were analyzed for the bpa concentration ; the mean value was 0 . 61 +/- 0 . 20 ng ml (- 1 ), with no correlation to the lipid content of milk samples .	0
effects of fibers on the color change and stability of resin composites after accelerated aging .. composite resins were reinforced with glass and polyethylene fibers in this study , and the effect of fiber reinforcement on the color change of composite resins was investigated . after accelerated aging , the effect of fiber reinforcement on the color stability of composite resins was also examined . there were three experimental groups ( n = 12 disks per group ): non - fiber - reinforced composite ( non - frc control ), polyethylene fiber ( ribbond - thm )- reinforced composite , and glass fiber ( everstick net )- reinforced composite . according to the critical remarks of color change of national bureau of standarts ( nsb ), glass fiber - reinforced anterior composites showed trace color change and polyethylene - fiber reinforced composites showed slight color change before accelerated aging . after accelerated aging , both control and fiber - reinforced composite groups showed noticeable color change . it was concluded that both the types of fiber reinforcement and composite resin influenced the color change of fiber - reinforced composite resins .	0
bacterial penetration and proliferation in root canal dentinal tubules after applying dentin adhesives in vitro .. endodontic treatment is aimed at eliminating infection and preventing bacterial regrowth in the root canal and dentinal tubules . in the present study the ability of two dentin adhesives to prevent bacterial penetration and subsequent proliferation in dentinal tubules was evaluated . cylindrical root specimens prepared from freshly extracted bovine teeth were used in an in vitro model of dentinal tubule infection . after removal of the smear layer the intracanal dentinal tubules of the specimens were acid - etched and treated with either gluma or ebs . untreated specimens served as controls . specimens were infected with enterococcus faecalis and incubated in brain heart infusion for 21 days . powder dentin samples obtained from within the canal lumina , using iso 025 to 033 burs , were examined for the presence of vital bacteria by inoculating on agar plates and counting colony - forming units . a significant difference was found between the experimental groups and the untreated group . after application with gluma specimens showed the least viable bacteria in dentinal tubules . data suggested that dentin adhesives reduced bacterial invasion into dentin and therefore have a potential role in endodontic treatment .	0
does incomplete caries removal reduce strength of restored teeth ?. little information is available about whether the presence of residual caries beneath an occlusal restoration affects fracture strength of the tooth . this in vitro study tested the hypothesis that restored teeth after incomplete excavation have lower fracture strengths than restored teeth after complete excavation . fourteen pairs of molars were randomly assigned to an experimental ( incomplete excavation ) or to a control group ( complete excavation ) and loaded vertically ( after cyclic loading ). failure load and fracture mode were recorded . restored teeth in the incomplete excavation group resulted in reduced fracture strength ( p < 0 . 001 ) of the tooth - restoration complex ( 1276 n ± 626 n ) compared with the control group ( 2768 n ± 710 n ). teeth in the complete excavation group all fractured vertically , while in the experimental group , cracks in the restoration were observed , characterized as ' ice - cracks '. the fracture strength of teeth restored over incomplete caries excavation was significantly reduced , possibly resulting in long - term clinical failure .	0
the effect of post - cure heating on residual , unreacted monomer in a commercial resin composite .. objectives : this paper examined the influence of post - cure temperature on the amount of unreacted monomer remaining in a commercial light - cured resin composite restoration following initial light - curing and subsequent post - cure heating . methods : discs of composite were light - cured and then subjected to immediate post - cure heating ( 50 , 75 , 100 , or 125 degrees c for 7 min ) or were left unheated ( control ). they were then placed in a solvent for two weeks at 37 degrees c to extract the unreacted monomer . hplc analysis was used to determine the amounts of tegdma , bis - gma , and ethoxylated bis - gma remaining after the different treatments . the amounts of each monomer leaching were compared using anova with respect to the different curing treatments . results : even the lowest post - cure heat treatment ( 50 degrees c ) resulted in 80 % reduction in remaining , unreacted tegdma , 75 % reduction in bis - gma , and 77 % lower ethoxylated bis - gma than the light - cured only control . post - cure heating at 75 degrees c and above resulted in the lowest amount of each type monomer remaining uncured in the polymer and did not significantly decrease with an increase in post - cure temperature for the most part . significance : one of the main benefits of post - cure heating of resin composite restorations could be the enhancement of biocompatibility of these restorations as a result of the significant decrease in potentially leachable , unreacted monomer .	0
the influence of the modification of etched bovine dentin on bond strengths .. objective : the aim of this study was to modify demineralized bovine dentin surfaces by application of either 12 . 5 % sodium hypochlorite ( naocl ), or 0 . 1 % ( w / w ) type i collagenase , after conditioning with phosphoric acid , to observe the demineralized surface and to investigate the effect on tensile bond strength . methods : the naocl was applied to etched dentin for 30 s , 1 or 2 min and the collagenase for 1 , 3 or 6 h . a control group was used without naocl or collagenase treatment . prior to bonding , treated surfaces were examined using an atomic force microscope ( afm ). a 2 . 3 mm diameter area of dentin was conditioned , treated and bonded with either one coat bond or single bond following each manufacturer ' s instructions , and a resin composite rod attached . bonds were stressed in tension at a rate of 1 mm / min until failure . mean bond strengths were calculated ( mpa ) and mode of failure was determined by observation at 20x magnification . results were analyzed using multiple regression analysis and lsd test at the 95 % level of confidence ( n = 12 ). results : afm results showed progressive changes of the surface collagen as the treatment time of naocl or collagenase increased . for both bonding systems , the bond strengths of 1 min naocl and 3 h collagenase treatments were significantly higher than the control or other treatment groups ( p < 0 . 05 ). bond failure consisted of mostly adhesive failure between dentin and resin combined with small regions exhibiting cohesive failure of resin . significance : bond strengths were not dependent on the thickness of the hybrid layer , but rather quality of the hybrid layer .	0
shear bond strength of 4th & 5th generation dentin bonding agents in the presence and absence of moisture . an in vitro study .. extracated human molars were used for the study , flat dentinal surfaces were prepared on the occlusal surfaces , and then 4th and 5th generation dentin bonding agents were used in dry and moist conditions to bond composite resin onto the flat dentin surfaces . shear bond strength was measured using instron universal testing machine . failures were recorded as adhesive , cohesive and mixed . bond strength was highest in moist condition , because the moist surface permits more porous collagen network and hence greater infiltration of adhesive monomers , than do surfaces that are air dried . moreover , those dentin bonding agents whose primers are based on acetone show improved bond strength , because acetone aggressively pursues and displaces water in the substrate , resulting in the primer resin being carried into tissue channels and porosities . when the dentin is air dried , the water that is supporting the collagen network evaporates causing the collagen network to collapse network is greatly reduced , which in turn decreases the premeability of intertubular dentin to adhesive resin and as a result causes decrease in bond strength . 5th generation dentin bonding agent showed significant improvement in the moist dentin bond strength .	0
clinical evaluation of three adhesive systems in class v non - carious lesions .. objectives : the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical retention of three new adhesive systems in non - carious cervical lesions during a 3 - year period . methods : the adhesive systems , a three - step ( ebs / pertac hybrid ), a one - bottle resin bonding agent ( one - step / pertac hybrid ) and a resin - modified glass ionomer cement ( fuji ii lc ) were placed in 148 non - carious cervical lesions , 87 with sclerotic dentin and 61 non - sclerotic . of the sclerotic lesions treated with the two resin bonding systems , 37 were slightly roughened with a diamond bur before conditioning . the restorations were evaluated every 6 months during a 3 - year period . results : all except six restorations were evaluated during the 3 years . the cumulative loss rates for ebs , one - step and fuji ii lc were , at 1 year : 2 , 24 and 2 % and at 3 years : 10 , 49 , 7 %, respectively . the one - bottle adhesive showed significantly more failures . the five lost ebs restorations were found in non - sclerotic lesions , while the three lost fuji ii lc restorations had been placed in sclerotic lesions . for the one - step material the loss frequency for non - sclerotic versus sclerotic lesions was 31 . 8 and 65 . 2 %, respectively . slight roughening of the sclerotic dentin surfaces with a diamond bur did not increase retention of the restorations . significance : the three - step resin adhesive and the rmgic showed clinically acceptable retention rates , while a high failure rate was registered for the one - bottle adhesive .	0
ozonation characteristics of bisphenol a in water .. ozonation characteristics of bisphenol a were investigated as a function of gaseous ozone dose , initial concentration of bisphenol a , ph , radical scavenger ( tert - butanol ), and radical initiator ( hydrogen peroxide ). the ozonation led to a complete removal of bisphenol a in water within a certain period of time . the overall rate of the ozonation linearly increased with the ozone dose . the stoichiometry in the ozonation of bisphenol a was found to be 1 . 5 - 1 . 8 mole of ozone per mole of bisphenol a . the direct reaction rate constants were 1 . 3 x 10 ( 4 ) m (- 1 ) s (- 1 ) for bisphenol a ( at ph = 2 ) and 1 . 6 x 10 ( 9 ) m (- 1 ) s (- 1 ) for dissociated bisphenol a ( at ph = 12 ). bisphenol a degraded via the direct reaction with molecular ozone in the ph range from 2 to 12 . degradation by oh radical was minor even at ph = 12 . the overall degradation rate in heterogeneous conditions was independent of ph as it was limited by ozone mass transfer rate . use of hydrogen peroxide did not alter the main degradation route and the molecular ozone remained a principal oxidant as a substantial portion of the oh radical is scavenged by hydrogen peroxide . effective ozone mass transfer may appear essential to enhance the ozonation kinetics of bisphenol a .	0
"""a 24 - month follow - up of flowable resin composite as an intermediate layer in non - carious cervical lesions .. this study compared the clinical performance of a microhybrid resin composite to lined class v restorations or to those restorations without a flowable resin composite over a 24 - month period . nineteen patients with at least 2 pairs of equivalent cervical erosion / attrition / abfraction lesions , under occlusion , were enrolled in this study . a total of 74 restorations were placed , half for each group ( single - bond + filtek - flow + filtek z250 or single - bond + filtek z250 ). according to the manufacturers ' instructions , 2 calibrated operators placed all restorations . two other independent examiners evaluated the restorations at baseline and after 24 months , according to the usphs criteria and modified criteria for color match . the classic alpha score was divided into a1 for """" not detectable """" and a2 for """" slightly discernible """" filling . statistical analysis was conducted using fisher ' s exact test ( alpha = 0 . 05 ). for each group , 8 restorations were lost after 24 months ( retention rate of 89 . 2 %). all the restorations showed a trend toward dark yellowing after 24 months ( color match a2 )."""	0
2 - year clinical evaluation of sodium hypochlorite treatment in the restoration of non - carious cervical lesions : a pilot study .. this pilot study evaluated the effect of removing acid - etch - exposed dentin collagen on the clinical performance of composite restorations of noncarious cervical lesions placed using 2 different adhesive systems . fifty - six restorations were placed in 14 subjects , each subject receiving at least 4 restorations . no cavity preparation or mechanical retention form was used . the variables tested were : 1 ) dentin treatment prior to application of the adhesive ( acid - etch only vs acid - etch and collagen removal ) and 2 ) type of adhesive ( acetone - vs ethanol - based ). for the acid - etch only groups , enamel and dentin were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 15 seconds , rinsed and blot dried . prime & bond 2 . 1 ( dentsply caulk ) or single bond ( 3m espe ) was applied and light - cured according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . for the acid - etch and collagen removal groups , the enamel and dentin were etched and rinsed in the same manner and a 10 % sodium hypochlorite ( naocl ) solution was applied for 60 seconds and rinsed before adhesive application . filtek z - 250 ( 3m espe ) was applied to all specimens and light - cured according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , and the restorations were finished and polished immediately . the restorations were evaluated for pre - and post - operative sensitivity , retention , marginal staining and secondary caries at baseline , 12 and 24 months after placement , using modified usphs criteria . data were analyzed using the kruskal - wallis and wilcoxon statistical tests ( p = 0 . 05 ). at 24 months , the retention rates for prime & bond 2 . 1 with and without naocl pretreatment were 80 % and 63 %, respectively . the corresponding retention rates for single bond were 70 % and 90 %. marginal staining was minimal . statistical analyses revealed no significant differences at any time interval between groups for retention or marginal staining . no post - operative sensitivity or secondary caries was detected during the study .	0
performance of a conventional sealant and a flowable composite on minimally invasive prepared fissures .. three different fissure preparation procedures were tested and compared to the non - invasive approach using a conventional unfilled sealant and a flowable composite . eighty permanent molars were selected and divided into 4 groups of 20 teeth each . all the teeth were split into 2 halves , and the exposed fissures were photographed under a microscope ( 35x ) before and after being prepared using the following methods : ( i ) er : yag laser ( key laser , kavo ) 600 mj pulse energy , 6 hz ; ( ii ) diamond bur ; ( iii ) er : yag laser ( key laser , kavo ) 200 mj pulse energy , 4 hz ; ( iv ) control group : powder jet cleaner ( prophyflex , kavo , germany ). the pre - and postimages were superimposed in order to evaluate the amount of hard tissue removed . ten teeth in each group were then acid etched and sealed with an unfilled sealant ( delton opaque , dentsply ), while the remaining 10 teeth were acid etched , primed and bonded ( prime & bond nt , dentsply ) and sealed with a flowable composite ( x - flow , detrey , dentsply ). material penetration and microleakage were evaluated after thermocycling ( 5000 cycles ) and staining with methylene blue 5 %. anova and mann - whitney tests were applied for statistical analysis . the laser 600 mj and bur eliminated the greatest amount of hard tissue . the control teeth presented the least microleakage when sealed with delton or x - flow . a correlation between material penetration and microleakage could not be statistically confirmed . mechanical preparation prior to fissure sealing did not enhance the final performance of the sealant .	0
influence of resin composite shade and location of the gingival margin on the microleakage of posterior restorations .. objective : the objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of resin composite shade and location of the gingival margin ( enamel or dentin ) on the microleakage of proximal restorations on posterior teeth . methods and materials : sixty freshly extracted human third molars were prepared with standardized class ii box - shaped cavities with proportional size and shape , with distal gingival margins located on the enamel and mesial gingival margins on dentin . the teeth were randomly divided into 6 groups according to resin shade ( n = 10 ): g1 - incisal ; g2 - a1 ; g3 - a2 ; g4 - a3 ; g5 - a3 . 5 ; g6 - a4 . the cavities were restored with a total - etch 1 - bottle adhesive system and microhybrid resin composites inserted in 4 increments , light cured for 20 seconds through the occlusal surface , then an additional 60 seconds for each surface . after 1 week of immersion in distilled water , the specimens were thermocycled ( 500 cycles , 5 degrees - 55 degrees c , 30 seconds dwell time ), sealed with nail polish and immersed in 0 . 5 % basic fuschin solution for 24 hours . the restorations were sectioned longitudinally , and microleakage was evaluated using a 0 - 3 score scale . results : data were subjected to kruskal - wallis and wilcoxon tests at p < 0 . 05 . no statistically significant differences between groups were observed regarding the shade of resin composite ( p = 0 . 8570 ). when margins ( enamel or dentin ) were considered separately , statistically significant differences were observed between groups ( p < 0 . 0001 ), with enamel margins exhibiting lower degrees of microleakage . conclusion : the variation of resin composite shades utilized in this study did not influence the microleakage of class ii restorations . however , the location of the gingival margin influenced the microleakage .	0
influence of additional adhesive application on the microtensile bond strength of adhesive systems .. this study evaluated microtensile bond strength ( ptbs ) when an additional adhesive layer was applied to the dentin surface . thirty - five human third molars were flattened to expose the occlusal dentin surface . the teeth were randomly assigned to 7 experimental groups : g1 - single bond ( sb ); g2 - additional layer of sb ; g3 -- a layer of scotchbond multi - purpose ( smp ) adhesive applied over sb ; g4 - clearfil se bond ( ce ); g5 - additional layer of ce ; g6 - adper prompt ( ap ) and g7 - additional layer of ap . for the g2 , g3 , g5 and g7 groups , the first adhesive layer was light - cured before application of the additional layer . after bonding procedures , 5 - mm high composite crowns were incrementally built up . the samples were sectioned to obtain 0 . 9 x 0 . 9 beams , which were tested under tension at a crosshead speed of 0 . 5 - mm / minute until failure . the failure mode and adhesive thickness were evaluated under sem . the ptbs data were analyzed by 1 - way anova and post - hoc ducan ' s test ( a = 0 . 05 ). mean adhesive thickness was analyzed by 1 - way anova and post - hoc tukey ' s test ( a = 0 . 05 ). the results indicated that g3 presented the highest microtbs and the thickest adhesive layer . g6 and g7 presented the lowest microtbs values . when solvent - free adhesives systems were used , microtbs values were not affected by the thicker layer .	0
seasonal and spatial distribution of several endocrine - disrupting compounds in the douro river estuary , portugal .. recent studies in the douro river estuary show signs of pollution in the area and of fish endocrine disruption . however , the chemical nature of the local contamination has not been fully investigated nor have studies checking for the simultaneous presence of endocrine - disrupting chemicals ( edcs ), either of animal ( estrone , e1 ; estradiol , e2 ), pharmaceutical ( 17alpha - ethynylestradiol , ee2 ), vegetal ( daidzein , daid ; genistein , gen ; biochanin a , bio - a ), or industrial ( bisphenol a , bpa ; 4 - octylphenol , 4 - op ; 4 - nonylphenol , 4 - np ) origins . thus , the main objective of this study was to examine the presence of these edcs in estuarine water samples collected , in every season of the year , at nine sampling stations along the estuarine gradient . all samples were processed by two - step solid - phase extraction ( oasis hlb followed by silica ) prior to high - performance liquid chromatography with diode - array detection ( hplc - dad ) and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ) analyses . the current data showed that e1 and ee2 , all phytoestrogens , and bpa were identified and measured in this estuary . in contrast , 4 - op was only detected by gc - ms and e2 and 4 - np were not found . additionally , e1 ( up to 112 . 9 ng / l ) and ee2 ( up to 101 . 9 ng / l ) were both measured in biologically hazardous amounts in winter . in the year sampled , the phytoestrogens suggested a possible seasonal pattern of fluctuation . both daid ( up to 888 . 4 ng / l ) and gen ( 183 . 6 ng / l ) were maximal in early summer , whereas bio - a ( up to 191 . 4 ng / l ) reached its highest concentrations in winter . bpa ( up to 10 . 7 microg / l ) also attained highest levels in winter . in december 2005 , it is hypothesized that e1 , ee2 , and bpa concentrations were atypically high due to current drought conditions . almost all assayed edcs existed in all seasons and , therefore , might have contributed to endocrine disruption of aquatic animals , previously documented by the high rate of ovotestis in fish caught in this estuary .	0
response of human pulps following acid conditioning and application of a bonding agent in deep cavities .. objectives : the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the human dental pulp response when a one - bottle adhesive system was applied on etched or unetched deep dentine . methods : eighteen class v deep cavity preparations were divided in three groups : group 1 - total etching + two coats of single bond ( sb ) + composite resin ( z - 100 ); group 2 - enamel etching + two coats of sb + z - 100 ; group 3 - cavity floor lined with a calcium hydroxide liner ( dycal ) + acid - etching of enamel and lateral walls + two coats of sb + z - 100 . two teeth were used as intact control group . after 30 days the teeth were extracted and processed through h and e , masson ' s trichrome and brown and brenn staining techniques . results : moderate inflammatory response , disorganization of pulp tissue , as well as , deposition of thin layer of reactionary dentin were observed in group 1 teeth in which the remaining dentin thickness ( rdt ) was less than 300 microm . these histological findings appear to be related to long resin tags formation and bonding agent diffusion through dentinal tubules . in group 2 , slight inflammatory response was observed only in one tooth in which the rdt was 162 microm . in group 3 , all the teeth showed normal histological characteristics which were similar to the intact control group . presence of bacteria was not correlated with the intensity of pulpal response . the patients reported no symptoms during the experiment . radiographic evaluation showed no periapical pathology for any of the teeth . significance and conclusions : acid - etched deep dentin ( rdt less than 300 microm ) lined with sb causes more intense pulpal response than unetched deep dentin . based on the results observed in the present study and the conditions in which it was carried out , we recommend the application of a biocompatible liner before etching deep dentin and applying sb .	0
influence of nd : yag laser irradiation on an adhesive restorative procedure .. hard tissue modification by means of laser irradiation is becoming popular in dentistry , since it promotes assorted responses between the tooth and the restorative material . some studies on the bond strength of adhesive systems to nd : yag irradiated teeth have shown distinctive behaviors when irradiation was applied before or after the adhesive agent . this study evaluated the microtensile bond strength of a commercial adhesive system to dentin irradiated with nd : yag laser after adhesive application but prior to polymerization . the experiment was conducted in vitro , using freshly extracted human teeth as samples . for the microtensile test , the teeth were separated into 4 different groups according to the energy density of laser irradiation : 0 , 5 , 10 and 50 j / cm2 . the data was analyzed with analysis of variance ( anova ) and lsd tests , and the results indicated that the group that was irradiated with 5 j / cm2 had significantly higher bond strength values . adhesive penetration on the etched dentin was observed by scanning electron microscopy , where the images showed better adhesive penetration on dentinal tubules after dentin irradiation with 5 j / cm2 . based on the results of this study , it is possible to conclude that irradiation of dentin with the nd : yag laser at low energy densities after application of the adhesive but prior to polymerization might be positive for the adhesive restorative process .	0
comparative profiling of the gene expression for estrogen responsiveness in cultured human cell lines .. it is important to know the difference as well as the similarity in estrogen responsiveness among cell lines for understanding the effects of estrogenic chemicals . here , using 120 estrogen responsive genes , we examined comparative expression profiles between the profile in breast cancer mcf - 7 cells treated with 17beta - estradiol and the profiles in other cell lines derived from breast ( t - 47d and hbc - 4 cells ), endometrium ( ishikawa cells ) and kidney ( rxf - 631l cells ) treated with estrogenic chemicals . first , comparative profiling between mcf - 7 and t - 47d cells showed similar ( correlation coefficient or r value = 0 . 49 - 0 . 87 ) profiles for all chemicals examined : 17beta - estradiol , estrone , estriol , diethylstilbestrol , bisphenol a , nonylphenol and genistein . the analysis using other cell lines indicated that significant correlations to the profile in mcf - 7 cells treated with 17beta - estradiol were observed for the profiles in ishikawa cells treated with 17beta - estradiol , diethylstilbestrol and bisphenol a , and hbc - 4 cells treated with 17beta - estradiol . the profiles for diethylstilbestrol and bisphenol a in hbc - 4 cells and all three chemicals in rxf - 631l cells did not show significant correlation with those in mcf - 7 cells . hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that there are cell - specific responses to estrogenic chemicals ( t - 47d and hbc - 4 cells for example ). correlation analysis using six ( proliferation , transcription , transport , enzymes , signaling and others ) functionally - categorized gene groups indicated that the genes related to enzymes showed greater correlations for all chemicals tested in t - 47d cells and some chemicals in ishikawa and hbc - 4 cells while those related to transcription contributed to variations .	0
unconjugated bisphenol a cord blood levels in boys with descended or undescended testes .. background : human toxicity of bisphenol a ( bpa ), a weak estrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting compound , widely used in plastics , baby bottles , cans and dental sealants , is under investigation . fetal or perinatal exposure in rodents is associated with programmed adult reproductive diseases . human epidemiological studies remain scarce , especially concerning testicular development . we have investigated the relationship between fetal exposure to bpa and cryptorchidism . methods : using a radioimmunoassay performed after extraction , validated by high - performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry , active levels of unconjugated bpa ( ubpa ) in cord blood ( cb ) were measured in 152 boys born after 34 weeks gestation , with cryptorchid or descended testes . results : active ubpa was detectable in all cb samples , with values in the control group ( n = 106 ) of 0 . 14 - 4 . 76 ng / ml , median : 0 . 9 ng / ml ; mean ± sd : 1 . 12 ng / ml ± 0 . 86 ng / ml , which did not differ from cryptorchid boys ( n = 46 , 1 . 26 ± 1 . 13 ng / ml , p = 0 . 38 ). ubpa in controls correlated with cb inhibin b ( p < 0 . 01 ) and total testosterone ( p < 0 . 05 ), and with maternal milk polychlorinated bisphenyl 138 ( p < 0 . 03 ). ubpa did not correlate with clinical maternal or fetal parameters or with other steroid or polypeptide cb hormones assessed . conclusions : the presence of ubpa in all cb samples suggests placental transfer and fetal exposure . similar ubpa levels in the control and cryptorchid groups make the participation of fetal exposure to ubpa in the physiopathology of undescended testes unlikely . however , the observed nanomolar ubpa concentrations support assessment of epidemiological relationships between cb ubpa and other human diseases .	0
[ endocrine disruptors and obesity : obesogens ].. incidence and prevalence of owerweight and obesity have greatly increased over the past three decades in almost all countries around the world . this phenomenon is not easily explained by lifestyle changes in populations with very different initial habits . this has led to consider the influence of other factors , the so - called endocrine disruptors , and more specifically obesogens . this study reviewed the available evidence about polluting chemical substances which may potentially be obesogens in humans : des , genistein , bisphenol a , organotins ( tbt , tpt ), and phthalates . the first three groups of substances mainly act upon estrogen receptors , while organotins and phthalates activate pparγ . it was concluded that evidence exists of the obesogenic effect of these chemical substances in tissues and experimental animals , but few data are available in humans .	1
unique bisphenol a transcriptome in prostate cancer : novel effects on erbeta expression that correspond to androgen receptor mutation status .. background : prostatic adenocarcinomas are dependent on androgen receptor ( ar ) activity for growth and progression , and therapy for disseminated disease depends on ablation of ar activity . recurrent tumors ultimately arise wherein ar has been re - activated . one mechanism of ar restoration is via somatic mutation , wherein cells containing mutant receptors become susceptible to activation by alternative ligands , including bisphenol a ( bpa ). in tumors with specific ar mutations , bpa promotes therapeutic bypass , suggesting significant negative impact to the clinical management of prostate cancer . objective : our goal was to determine the mechanism of bpa action in cancer cells carrying bpa - responsive ar mutants . methods : the molecular signature of bpa activity in prostate cancer cells harboring mutant ar was delineated via genetic microarray analysis . specificity of bpa action was assessed by comparison with the molecular signature elicited by dihydrotestosterone ( dht ). results : bpa and dht elicited distinct transcriptional signatures in prostate cancer cells expressing the bpa - responsive mutant ar - t877a . bpa dramatically attenuated estrogen receptor beta ( erbeta ) expression ; this finding was specific to prostate tumor cells in which bpa induces cellular proliferation . conclusions : bpa induces a distinct gene expression signature in prostate cancer cells expressing somatic ar mutation , and a major molecular consequence of bpa action is down - regulation of erbeta . since erbeta functions to antagonize ar function and ar - dependent proliferation , these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which bpa likely regulates cellular proliferation . future investigation directed at dissecting the importance of erbeta in the proliferative response to bpa will establish the contribution of this event to adverse effects associated with human exposure .	0
endocrine disruption of water and sediment extracts in a non - radioactive dot blot / rnase protection - assay using isolated hepatocytes of rainbow trout .. goal , scope and background : in order to evaluate the estrogenic activity of sediments and xad water extracts of selected sites of the catchment area of the river neckar , a river system in southern germany , an integrative assessment approach was used to assess the ecological hazard potential of endocrine - disrupting compounds in sediment and water . methods : the approach is based on estrogen receptor - mediated vitellogenin synthesis induced in isolated hepatocytes of rainbow trout and quantified in a non - radioactive dot blot / rnase protection - assay in parallel to comprehensive chemical analyses of estrogenic substances . results and discussion : numerous investigated extracts revealed an estrogen activity comparable to that of the positive control ( 1 nm 17beta - estradiol corresponding to 270 ng / l in the test medium ). based on a concentration factor of 30 in the extracts and a recovery of xad resins of approximately 80 %, 17beta - estradiol equivalent concentrations between 20 and 26 . 7 ng / l could be calculated downstream of a sewage treatment plant (< 0 . 1 ng / l for a reference site ). a comparison of the bioassay - derived bio - teqs ( toxicity equivalents ) and the chem - teqs revealed a high correlation with a pearson coefficient of 0 . 85 , indicating that the same ranking of the samples could be obtained with respect to the endocrine disrupting potential with both chemical and bioanalytical analysis . however , the teq concentrations computed from chemical analyses were significantly lower than the bioassay - derived teq concentrations . in fact , in none of the samples , more than 14 % of the vitellogenin - inducing potency could be attributed to the substances ( steroids , alkylphenols , bisphenol a , diethylstilbestrol ) analyzed . a comparison of the endocrine disrupting potential of sediments extracted by the solvents acetone and methanol revealed lower biological effects for acetone - extracted samples . possible reasons may be a masking of endocrine effects in acetone extracts by cytotoxicity , a low extraction efficiency of the solvent acetone , or anti - estrogen potencies of some extracted sediment compounds . using a mass balance approach , the contribution of the compounds analyzed chemically ( chem - teqs ) to the total endocrine activity ( bio - teqs ) was calculated . based on the very low detection limits , particularly of the steroids with their high tef factors , results revealed that a calculation of the chem - teqs is associated with considerable scale inaccuracy : whereas only 7 - 15 % of the biological effectiveness ( bio - teqs ) could be explained by endocrine substances identified above the detection limits , the assumption of concentrations slightly below the given detection limits would result in a significant over estimation ( 137 - 197 %) of the bio - teqs . even the interassay variation of the dot blot assay with different fish donors for primary hepatocyte ( factor 2 - 2 . 5 ) is relatively low , when compared to the large range of the chem - teq concentrations ( factor 20 ) obtained when applying different modes of calculation . conclusions and outlook : overall , only a minor portion of the endocrine activity detected by bioassays could be linked to compounds identified by chemical analysis . in vitro assays for assessment of endocrine activities are useful as sensitive integrating methods that provide quantitative estimates of the total activity of particular receptor - mediated responses . although discrepancies may also result from different bioanalytical approaches , it is overall likely that bioanalytical and not chemical analytical approaches give the correct estimate of endocrine disrupting potencies in environmental samples . as a conclusion , assessment of endocrine disruption based on chemical analysis alone does not appear sufficient and further research into the spectrum of substances with potential endocrine activity as well as into additive or even synergistic effects in complex environmental samples is urgently needed .	0

effect of filler particle size and morphology on force / work parameters for stickiness of unset resin - composites .. objectives : to investigate the effect of variation in filler particle size and morphology within an unset model series of resin - composites on two stickiness parameters : ( 1 ) maximum probe separation - force and ( 2 ) work - of - separation . this study was to complement previously reported measurements of composite stickiness in terms of a strain - parameter , ' peak - height '. materials and methods : eleven experimental light cured resin - composites were selected . all had the same matrix ( bis - gma , udma and tegdma , with 0 . 33 % camphoroquinone ) and the same filler volume fraction - 56 . 7 %, however filler particles varied in size and shape and were either unimodal or multimodal in size - distribution . each material was placed in a cylindrical mould ( phi = 7mmx5mm depth ) held at 26 or 37 degrees c . the maximum force ( f ( max ), n ) and work of probe - separation ( w ( s ), nmm ) were measured . a flat - ended stainless - steel probe ( phi = 6mm ) was mechanically lowered onto and into the surface of the unset sample , until a compressive force of 1n was reached , which was held constant for 1s . then the probe was moved vertically upward at a constant speed ; either 2 or 8mm / s . the tensile force produced on the probe by the sticky composite was plotted against displacement and the maximum value was identified ( f ( max )). w ( s ) was obtained as the integrated area . data was analyzed by multivariate anova and multiple pair - wise comparisons using a tukey post hoc test to establish homogenous subsets ( at p = 0 . 05 ) for f ( max ) and a games - howell was used for w ( s ). results : as potential measures of stickiness , f ( max ) and w ( s ) showed more coherent trends with fillersize when measured at the lower of the two probe speeds , 2mm / s . for unimodal resin - composite f ( max ) ranged from 1 . 04 to 5 . 11n and w ( s ) from 0 . 48 to 11 . 12nmm . for the multimodal resin - composite they ranged from 1 . 64 to 4 . 13n and from 2 . 32 to 8 . 34nmm respectively . temperature increase tended to slightly reduce f ( max ), although this trend was not consistent . w ( s ) generally increased with temperature . conclusion : filler particle size and morphology influences f ( max ) and w ( s ) of uncured resin - composite which partly express the handling behaviors of resin - composites .	0
surface substance loss of subsurface bovine enamel lesions after different steps of the resinous infiltration technique : a 3d topography analysis .. surface substance loss of subsurface enamel lesions before ( baseline / demineralization ) and after each step of the infiltration technique was evaluated by means of a three - dimensional focus variation . eighty enamel specimens were prepared and partially varnished ( control ). non - varnished areas were demineralized ( ph 4 . 95 ; 28 days ), and etched with phosphoric acid gel ( 20 %; 5 s ). specimens were randomly assigned to eight groups ( n = 10 ), and were infiltrated using four resinous materials . in subgroups 1 , polymerization and finishing with abrasive polishing strips followed . in subgroups 2 , excess material was removed before polymerization ( e1 / e2 - excite , vivadent ; f1 / f2 - fortify , bisco ; g1 / g2 - glaze & bond , dmg ; i1 / i2 - icon , dmg ). topometrical evaluation revealed a negligible substance loss of demineralized enamel . after etching , mean (± sd ) differences of height decreased uniformly (- 6 . 6 ± 2 . 0 μm ; p = 0 . 089 ; anova ). for infiltrated lesions , dh of subgroups 1 was comparable to the etched lesions , with a significant increase ( compared to etched lesions ) in subgroups 2 ( 1 . 1 ± 0 . 1 μm ; p < 0 . 001 ; t test ). within the limitations of this study , it is concluded that etching of initial subsurface lesions will result in significant surface substance loss ; removal of excess material before light - curing should simplify the infiltration procedure , and this will avoid any abrasion resulting from polishing procedures .	0
bisphenol a facilitates bypass of androgen ablation therapy in prostate cancer .. prostatic adenocarcinomas depend on androgen for growth and survival . first line treatment of disseminated disease exploits this dependence by specifically targeting androgen receptor function . clinical evidence has shown that androgen receptor is reactivated in recurrent tumors despite the continuance of androgen deprivation therapy . several factors have been shown to restore androgen receptor activity under these conditions , including somatic mutation of the androgen receptor ligand - binding domain . we have shown previously that select tumor - derived mutants of the androgen receptor are receptive to activation by bisphenol a ( bpa ), an endocrine - disrupting compound that is leached from polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins into the human food supply . moreover , we have shown that bpa can promote cell cycle progression in cultured prostate cancer cells under conditions of androgen deprivation . here , we challenged the effect of bpa on the therapeutic response in a xenograft model system of prostate cancer containing the endogenous bpa - responsive ar - t877a mutant protein . we show that after androgen deprivation , bpa enhanced both cellular proliferation rates and tumor growth . these effects were mediated , at least in part , through androgen receptor activity , as prostate - specific antigen levels rose with accelerated kinetics in bpa - exposed animals . thus , at levels relevant to human exposure , bpa can modulate tumor cell growth and advance biochemical recurrence in tumors expressing the ar - t877a mutation .	0
limited slowdown of endocrine - disruptor diffusion in confined fluid lipid membranes .. self - diffusion rates of lipids and trapped bisphenol a ( bpa ) are determined in various sizes of confined but fluid membranes by high - field - gradient nmr at 600 mhz . micelles and vesicles of 3 - to 400 - nm diameters are used as model membranes to get an insight into the molecular diffusion in such soft environments . the slowdown of bpa and lipid motions is leveled off in 100 - and 400 - nm vesicles , although the hydrodynamic continuum model gives the aggregate motion slowed inversely to the aggregate size . instead , the limited motion is related to the intra - membrane fluidity .	0
frontal bone defect repair with experimental glass - fiber - reinforced composite with bioactive glass granule coating .. objective : the aim of this preliminary study was to test the bioactive glass - coated fiber - reinforced composite ( frc ) as a reconstruction material in the treatment of experimental defects in the frontal bone of rabbits . methods : frc made of e - glass fiber and bisgma - pmma resin matrix system was used in the study . pieces of nonpolymerized frc were coated with particulate bioactive glass granules s53p4 ( bag ), and then the frc was polymerized and post - cured by heat in air to reduce the quantity of residual monomers , and to sterilize the material for the animal study . two round defects ( 5 mm in diameter ) were drilled in the upper bony walls of 12 nzw rabbits ' frontal sinuses , and rectangular frc plates were applied over the defects . in the control group , no frc plates were used . the bone defect healing process was evaluated on histological sections at 3 , 6 , and 8 weeks , postoperatively . sem - edx analysis was used to determine reactive layers of bioactive glass granules . results : the healing progressed from the fibroconnective tissue phase at 3 weeks to lamellar bone formation at 6 and 8 weeks . the difference in new bone formation between the implantation groups and control groups was not statistically significant , although in some animals the effect of the implant on bone healing was clearly positive . a moderate foreign body reaction was seen on the implant surface where bag granules did not uniformly cover the implant ' s polymer matrix . conclusions : this study suggests that the tested frc implant with bioactive glass coating provides an alternative for bone defect reconstruction . however , more research on this composite material and its biocompatibility is needed .	0
the genomic response of ishikawa cells to bisphenol a exposure is dose - and time - dependent .. a reliable in vitro model to determine the potential estrogenic activity of chemicals of interest is still unavailable . to further investigate the usefulness of a human - derived cell line , we determined the transcriptional changes induced by bisphenol a ( bpa ) in ishikawa cells at various doses ( 1 nm , 100 nm , 10 microm , and 100 microm ) and time points ( 8 , 24 and 48 h ) by comparing the response of approximately 38 , 500 human genes and ests between treatment groups and controls ( vehicle - treated ). by trend analysis , we determined that the expression of 2794 genes was modified by bpa in a dose - and time - dependent manner ( p < or = 0 . 0001 ). however , the majority of gene expression changes induced in ishikawa cells were elicited by the highest doses of bpa evaluated ( 10 - 100 microm ), while the genomic response of the cells exposed to low doses of bpa was essentially negligible . by comparing the ishikawa cells ' response to bpa vs . 17 alpha - ethynyl estradiol we determined that the change in the expression of 307 genes was identical in the direction of the change , although the magnitude of the change for some genes was different . further , the response of ishikawa cells to high doses of bpa shared similarities to the estrogenic response of the rat uterus , specifically , 362 genes were regulated in a similar manner in vivo as well as in vitro . gene ontology analysis indicated that bpa results in changes to multiple molecular pathways affecting various biological processes particularly associated with cell organization and biogenesis , regulation of translation , cell proliferation , and intracellular transport ; processes also affected by estrogen exposure in the uterus of the rat . these results indicate that ishikawa cells are capable of generating a biologically relevant estrogenic response after exposure to chemicals with varied estrogenic activity , and offer an in vitro model to assess this mode of action .	0
simultaneous determination of hexabromocyclododecane , tetrabromobisphenol a , and related compounds in sewage sludge and sediment samples from ebro river basin ( spain ).. this paper describes the development of a methodology for the simultaneous determination and quantification of hexabromocyclododecane ( hbcd ), tetrabromobisphenol a ( tbbpa ), and related compounds ( bisphenol a , monobromobisphenol a , dibromobisphenol a , and tribromobisphenol a ) in sludge and sediment samples . the selected method is based on an extraction with dichloromethane : methanol followed by purification via spe c ( 18 ) cartridges . instrumental determination was carried out by liquid chromatography - quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry ( lc - qqlit - ms ), with quantification based on isotopic dilution method . analyte recoveries were in the range of 39 - 120 % and 88 - 126 % for spiked sewage and sediment , respectively . repeatability of replicate extractions was better than 13 % relative standard deviation . linearity was checked in the range of 0 . 05 and 25 injected nanograms . limits of detection ( lods ) and limits of quantification ( loqs ) were in the range of 0 . 6 and 2 . 7 ng / g and 1 . 4 and 66 ng / g for sediment and sludge samples , respectively . the developed method was applied to sewage sludge and sediment samples collected along the ebro river and cinca river , one of its tributaries ( northeast of spain ). tbbpa levels in sewage sludge ranged from not quantified to 1 , 329 ng / g dw , whereas levels in sediment samples were lower , between not detected and 15 ng / g dw . as regards hbcd , concentrations were between not detected and 375 ng / g for sludge samples and 0 . 8 and 1850 ng / g for sediments .	0

the relationship of weight loss to surface roughness of composite resins from simulated toothbrushing .. this study was designed to measure percentage of weight loss during simulated toothbrushing of five different composite resins . the surface roughness of each composite resin was also measured after each year of simulated toothbrushing for a period of 5 years . the following conclusions were reached : 1 . despite the loss of toothbrush efficiency , all composite resins tested tended to have a decreasing wear rate with the increasing time of toothbrushing . 2 . profile ( with a soft filler ) and isopast ( with a microsized filler ) showed the greatest resistance to abrasion and retained the smoothest surface . 3 . prestige , which demonstrated the greatest percent weight loss , also has a soft barium filler . loss of the filler as an alkaline reaction in water due to soluble barium compounds may cause the binder to release filler particles prematurely .	0
p - nonylphenol , 4 - tert - octylphenol and bisphenol a increase the expression of progesterone receptor mrna in the frontal cortex of adult ovariectomized rats .. alkylphenols , such as p - nonylphenol ( np ) and 4 - tert - octylphenol ( op ) and bisphenol a ( bpa ) are thought to mimic oestrogens in their action , and are called endocrine disrupters . we examined whether these endocrine disrupters affected progesterone receptor ( pr ) mrna expression in the adult female rat neocortex . in one experiment , at 12 . 00 h , ovariectomized rats were given a subcutaneous injection of 10 mg of np , 10 mg of op or 10 mg of bpa , or sesame oil alone as control . twenty - four hours after injection , the left side of the frontal cortex , parietal cortex and temporal cortex was collected . in a second experiment to study the time - course of the effects of bpa on pr mrna , the ovariectomized rats were given a subcutaneous injection of 10 mg of bpa and killed 0 , 6 , 12 and 24 h after injection . in addition to the frontal cortex and temporal cortex , the occipital cortex was also collected . northern blotting revealed that , in the first experiment , injection of np , op or bpa significantly increased pr mrna expression in the frontal cortex but not in the parietal cortex . in the temporal cortex , bpa significantly decreased pr mrna , but np and op produced no significant changes . the second experiment revealed that , in the frontal cortex , bpa induced a significant increase in pr mrna expression at 6 h after injection , which lasted until 24 h after injection . in the temporal cortex , pr mrna expression was significantly decreased 6 h after injection of bpa and was still significantly low 24 h after injection . no significant change was observed in the occipital cortex . these results suggest that , even in adult rats , endocrine disrupters alter the neocortical function by affecting the pr system , although the physiological significance of pr in the affected area is unknown .	0
pharmacological modulation of genome and proteome alterations in mice treated with the endocrine disruptor bisphenol a .. among endocrine disruptors , the xenoestrogen bisphenol a ( bpa ) is of particular interest due to the very high production and widespread environmental contamination . we recently demonstrated that the oral administration of bpa to mice results in the formation of dna adducts not only in liver but also in mammary tissue . the present study aimed at evaluating the modulation of bpa - related dna adducts and proteome alterations by the chemopreventive agents budesonide ( bud ) and phenethyl isothiocyanate ( peitc ). swiss icr ( cd - 1 ) mice received , for 8 days , bpa with the drinking water and either chemopreventive agent with the diet . we measured dna adducts by ( 32 ) p postlabeling and 656 proteins by antibody microarray . bpa induced the formation , with similar patterns , of dna adducts in liver and in mammary tissue . moreover , bpa dysregulated 13 proteins in mammary tissue , mostly in the sense of upregulation , including estrogen receptor - beta and proteins involved in cell proliferation , inhibition of apoptosis , tissue remodeling , inflammation , stress response , and glutathione synthesis . peitc significantly inhibited the formation of bpa - induced dna adducts , but only at the highest dose tested , and bud was totally ineffective . the chemopreventive agents modulated a variety of bpa - induced changes in proteome profiles . however , as shown by both hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis , bud and especially peitc were not able to restore the physiological situation in bpa - treated mice . therefore , the in vivo use of proteome analysis proves to be a sensitive tool for the early prediction not only of protective effects but also of adverse effects of chemopreventive agents .	0
the effect of bonding agents on the microleakage and bond strength of sealant in primary teeth .. this in vitro study investigated the effect of use of three dentine bonding agents : scotchbond multi - purpose plus ( 3m dental products , st . paul , minnesota , u . s . a .), syntac ( vivadent , schaan , liechtenstein ), optibond dual cure ( kerr , romulus , mi , u . s . a .) on microleakage and shear bond strength of a fissure sealant ( helioseal f , vivadent , schaan , liechtenstein ) bonded to either dry or wet ( saliva contaminated ) enamels of primary teeth . newly extracted 112 non - carious primary teeth were sectioned and embedded in resin blocks . eight groups were formed for each test . each group consisted of 14 specimens . group 1 and 2 : fissure sealant was applied directly to etched enamel in dry and wet condition , respectively ; group 3 and 4 : fissure sealant was applied onto etched and scotch - bond multi - purpose plus treated enamel in dry and wet condition , respectively ; group 5 and 6 : fissure sealant was applied onto etched and syntac treated enamel in dry and wet condition , respectively ; group 7 and 8 : fissure sealant was applied onto etched and optibond dual cure treated enamel in dry and wet condition , respectively . the results revealed that the use of an enamel - dentine bonding agent under fissure sealant increased the bond strength and decreased the microleakage . the use of enamel - dentine bonding agents under sealant in moisture contaminated conditions gave better results than applying sealant alone onto non - contaminated teeth . finally , scotchbond multi - purpose plus yielded the best results for both tests .	0
administration of bisphenol a to dams during perinatal period modifies molecular and morphological reproductive parameters of the offspring .. bisphenol a ( bpa ) is an estrogenic agonist compound that induces changes in diverse reproductive parameters in rats . the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of bpa given in drinking water containing 10mg / l ( approximate dose 1 . 2mg / kg bw / day ), administered chronically to rats during pregnancy and lactation , on reproductive tract parameters of the offspring . 79 . 2 % of the female offspring from bpa - treated mothers presented irregular estrous cycles . as compared to the control group , a significant increase in the thickness of the uterine epithelia and stroma was observed in the bpa group . additionally , 60 % of the female offspring from bpa mothers did not undergo abundant uterine epithelial apoptosis during the estrus phase of the cycle while control animals did . in addition , a down regulation of erα expression was observed in epithelial cells on estrus day . the results indicate that bpa , when administered chronically in water beverages to dams , modifies the reproductive cycle of the offspring during young adulthood .	0
three - year follow - up of five posterior composites : sem study of differential wear .. assessing the wear of both enamel and composite at a shared occlusal contact area offers the opportunity to determine the differential wear between enamel and composite on the same tooth . differential wear measurements were carried out on five posterior composite materials with an accurate 3d - measuring technique . the distinct wear step between enamel and composite was visualized by means of scanning electron photomicrographs . both investigated ultrafine midway - filled and fine compact - filled composites ( willems et al ., 1992a ) have a considerably higher differential wear value and are , therefore , less suitable for rehabilitation of posterior teeth than are the ultrafine compact - filled composites , which have , in this study , a very satisfactory differential wear rate and appear to be highly wear resistant materials suitable for use in stress - bearing areas .	0
dental composite restorations and neuropsychological development in children : treatment level analysis from a randomized clinical trial .. background : resin - based dental restorations may intra - orally release their components and bisphenol a . gestational bisphenol a exposure has been associated with poorer executive functioning in children . objectives : to examine whether exposure to resin - based composite restorations is associated with neuropsychological development in children . methods : secondary analysis of treatment level data from the new england children ' s amalgam trial , a 2 - group randomized safety trial conducted from 1997 to 2006 . children ( n = 534 ) aged 6 - 10 y with ≥ 2 posterior tooth caries were randomized to treatment with amalgam or resin - based composites ( bisphenol - a - diglycidyl - dimethacrylate - composite for permanent teeth ; urethane dimethacrylate - based polyacid - modified compomer for primary teeth ). neuropsychological function at 4 - and 5 - year follow - up ( n = 444 ) was measured by a battery of tests of executive function , intelligence , memory , visual - spatial skills , verbal fluency , and problem - solving . multivariable generalized linear regression models were used to examine the association between composite exposure levels and changes in neuropsychological test scores from baseline to follow - up . for comparison , data on children randomized to amalgam treatment were similarly analyzed . results : with greater exposure to either dental composite material , results were generally consistent in the direction of slightly poorer changes in tests of intelligence , achievement or memory , but there were no statistically significant associations . for the four primary measures of executive function , scores were slightly worse with greater total composite exposure , but statistically significant only for the test of letter fluency ( 10 - surface - years β =- 0 . 8 , se = 0 . 4 , p = 0 . 035 ), and the subtest of color naming ( β =- 1 . 5 , se = 0 . 5 , p = 0 . 004 ) in the stroop color - word interference test . multivariate analysis of variance confirmed that the negative associations between composite level and executive function were not statistically significant ( manova , p = 0 . 18 ). results for greater amalgam exposure were mostly nonsignificant in the opposite direction of slightly improved scores over follow - up . conclusions : dental composite restorations had statistically insignificant associations of small magnitude with impairments in neuropsychological test change scores over 4 - or 5 - years of follow - up in this trial .	0
tensile bond strengths of five luting agents to two cad - cam restorative materials and enamel .. statement of problem : cad - cam restorative materials are popular because they have high esthetic value and short fabrication time . unfortunately these materials are brittle and tend to fracture under heavy occlusal load . purpose : the purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the tensile bond strengths of 5 luting agents to 2 cad - cam restorative materials and enamel . material and methods one hundred truncated cones , with a 3 - mm diameter bonding surface and 5 - mm diameter base , were fabricated with dicor mgc ( n = 50 ) or cerec vitablocs mark ii ( n = 50 ) with the cerec system . enamel surfaces of the crowns of 100 freshly extracted noncarious , anterior teeth , stored in 0 . 9 % saline solution with 0 . 25 % sodium azide ( nan ( 3 )) as disinfectant , were prepared with sandpaper disks ( 320 - grit size ) on the buehler variable speed grinder - polisher . the bonding surfaces of the dicor mgc or cerec vitablocs mark ii truncated cones from each of the 2 tests systems were airborne particle abraded , chemically etched , and cemented on the prepared enamel surface of the tooth specimens with 5 luting agents : vita cerec duo cement , enforce , panavia 21 , c & b metabond , and fuji duet . all specimens were thermocycled 1000 times , in 5 degrees c and 55 degrees c water with a dwell time of 30 seconds in each temperature . tensile force ( mpa ) was applied perpendicular to the bonding surfaces of the specimens with a universal testing machine until fracture . fracture patterns were examined with a microscope at original magnification x10 . the differences in the tensile bond strengths were analyzed with the tukey - kramer test ( alpha =. 05 ). results : the mean tensile bond strengths of dicor mgc bonding to enamel with luting agents in descending order in mpa were enforce ( 10 . 12 +/- 2 . 25 ), panavia 21 ( 7 . 28 +/- 1 . 77 ), cerec duo ( 5 . 32 +/- 1 . 65 ), fuji duet ( 3 . 73 +/- 1 . 78 ), and c & b metabond ( 3 . 11 +/- 1 . 11 ). enforce had a significantly higher bond strength than c & b metabond , fuji duet , cerec duo , and panavia 21 ( p =. 05 ). the mean tensile bond strengths of cerec vitablocs mark ii bonding to enamel with luting agents in descending order in mpa were as follow : fuji duet ( 11 . 51 +/- 2 . 79 ), enforce ( 9 . 44 +/- 2 . 03 ), c & b metabond ( 8 . 98 +/- 3 . 29 ), cerec duo ( 8 . 66 +/- 4 . 71 ), and panavia 21 ( 5 . 10 +/- 2 . 49 ). within this group , there was no significant difference between fuji duet and enforce , but the bond strength of fuji duet was significantly higher than that of c & b metabond , panavia 21 , and cerec duo ( p =. 05 ). the mean tensile strength of all the luting agents bonded to cerec vitablocs mark ii and enamel ( 8 . 74 mpa ) was higher than dicor mgc and enamel ( 5 . 91 mpa ). conclusion : in this in vitro study ; within the dicor mgc group , the mean bond strength of panavia 21 with enamel was significantly higher than c & b metabond , panavia 21 , cerec duo , and fuji duet . within the cerec vitablocs mark ii group , the mean bond strength of fuji duet was significantly higher than c & b metabond , panavia 21 , and cerec duo but was not significantly higher than enforce .	0
effect of dentin primer on shear bond strength of composite resin to moist and dry enamel .. the etched enamel - composite resin bond is the most reliable bond known to us . moisture and dentin primers are the two most important variables that can interfere with this bond . this study investigated the effect of dentin primer on bond strengths of composite resin to moist and dry enamel . one hundred freshly extracted molar teeth were used for shear bond strength testing . the teeth were mounted in phenolic rings with an approximal enamel surface exposed . the exposed enamel surface on each tooth was flattened using 320 - 400 - and 600 - grit silicon carbide papers and etched using 34 - 38 % phosphoric acid gel . the teeth were then divided into 10 groups ( n = 10 ). four groups were assigned to each of the two dentin bonding systems , scotchbond multi - purpose and optibond fl . two groups were assigned to the single - bottle bonding agent ( single bond ). each bonding system was tested on moist and dry enamel . optibond fl and scotchbond mp were tested with and without the use of primer . all samples were thermocycled and tested in shear . fracture analysis was performed using a binocular microscope . for scanning electron microscopy , approximal samples of enamel ( 1 mm thick ) were flattened , etched , and bonded with and without primer on moist and dry enamel . a 1 mm - thick layer of z100 was bonded to the specimens , which were then immersed in 10 % hcl for 24 hours to dissolve the enamel . the specimens were viewed under a scanning electron microscope . results indicated that the use of primer on dry enamel did not significantly affect ( p > 0 . 05 ) shear bond strengths for the two bonding systems , scotchbond mp ( primed 24 . 10 +/- 4 . 83 mpa , unprimed 29 . 57 +/- 7 . 49 mpa ) and optibond fl ( primed 26 . 82 +/- 4 . 44 , unprimed 25 . 66 +/- 2 . 95 ). however , the use of primer was found to be essential on moist enamel to obtain acceptable bond strengths with both scotchbond mp ( primed 25 . 61 +/- 10 . 29 mpa , unprimed 3 . 26 +/- 0 . 95 mpa ) and optibond fl ( primed 30 . 28 +/- 3 . 49 mpa , unprimed 8 . 37 +/- 3 . 31 mpa ). moisture on enamel did not significantly affect ( p > 0 . 05 ) bond strengths for the single - bottle bonding agent , single bond ( moist enamel 31 . 34 +/- 9 . 03 mpa , dry enamel 27 . 93 +/- 5 . 41 mpa ). fracture analysis revealed that most fractures were adhesive or mixed , with a greater percentage being cohesive for the groups with dry enamel or with primer on moist enamel . scanning electron micrographs corroborated the shear bond strength data . the specimens without primer on moist enamel showed very poor penetration of adhesive and composite resin into the etched enamel microporosities .	0
changes in brain monoamine levels in neonatal rats exposed to bisphenol a at low doses .. to examine whether exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ) at low levels affect brain function , monoamine concentrations in hippocampus , striatum and brain stem , were investigated in neonatal male rats injected intracranially with bpa at 0 - 10microgkg (- 1 ). significant increases of serotonin ( 5 - ht ) in hippocampus , 5 - hiaa and 5 - hiaa / 5 - ht in brain stem , dopamine ( da ) and dopac in striatum were observed at 28d after the injection on postnatal day 2 . at 7d after the injection , increases in 5 - ht and norepinephrine ( ne ) and decreases in dopac and 5 - hiaa were observed in hippocampus . to investigate the degradation of bpa in brain , we also measured bpa concentrations of whole neonatal rat brain . free bpa disappeared from brain tissues within 5h , even when the highest dose ( 1000microgkg (- 1 )) was injected . the present results suggest that bpa exposure at lower doses than environmentally relevant levels may have a great impact on monoamine levels in neonatal brain over 28d after its disappearance .	0
identification of estrogenic compounds in wastewater effluent .. in order to identify the dominant contributors to estrogenic activity in environmental waters , a comprehensive fractionation method using silica gel column chromatography , combined with recombinant yeast assay for detecting estrogenic activity and with gas chromatography - mass spectrometry for quantifying endocrine disruptors and natural estrogens , was developed . the method was applied to the municipal sewage treatment plant ( stp ) secondary effluent discharged to the tamagawa river in tokyo , japan , where endocrine disruption was observed in wild carp . the instrumental analysis demonstrated that averaged concentrations of nonylphenol , bisphenol a , estrone ( e1 ), and 17beta - estradiol ( e2 ) were 564 +/- 127 , 27 +/- 19 , 33 +/- 11 , and 4 . 6 +/- 3 . 0 ng / l , respectively . based on the concentration and relative potency of these compounds , the natural estrogens e1 and e2 represented more than 98 % of the total estrogen equivalent concentration ( eeq ) in the stp effluent , while the contribution of phenolic compounds to total eeq was less than 2 %. estrogenic activities associated with the dissolved phase of the effluent samples were detected by a recombinant yeast assay . by using silica gel column chromatography , the dissolved phase was separated into several fractions that were subjected to the bioassay . the polar fractions exhibited estrogenic activity . the greatest estrogenic activity was found in a polar fraction containing e1 and e2 and represented 66 to 88 % of the total estrogenic activities estimated from the bioassay data . these results lead to the conclusion that e1 and e2 were the dominant environmental estrogens in the stp effluent , but a significant contribution to estrogenic activities stems from unidentified components in the effluents .	0
leakage pathway of class v cavities restored with different flowable resin composite restorations .. this study investigated the leakage pathway of facial and lingual class v cavities restored with different flowable resin composites bonded with one bonding agent by examining the resin / dentin interface . forty class v cavities were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid gel ; single bond dental adhesive was applied , then the cavities were randomly divided into four groups ( n = 10 ). three groups were restored with one of three flowable resin composites ( grandio flow , filtek flow and admira flow ). the fourth group was restored with z250 ( hybrid resin composite ) to serve as a control . the specimens were then placed in 50 % w / v silver nitrate solution for 24 hours and immersed in a photodeveloping solution for eight hours . thereafter , the specimens were sectioned bucco - lingually , polished , mounted on stubs , gold sputter coated and examined by scanning electron microscope . silver particle penetration length with and without gap formation was measured directly on the scanning electron microscope monitor and calculated as a percentage of the total length of the cut dentin surface that was penetrated by silver nitrate . the data were analyzed with one - way anova and tukey hsd test . the groups restored with filtek flow and admira flow showed a microleakage pattern where silver nitrate penetration was observed with gap formation at the tooth / restoration interface and filtek flow recorded significantly higher leakage than admira flow . grandio flow showed similar marginal adaptation to z250 resin composite with no gap formation at the interface . however , silver ions had penetrated beneath the resin - impregnated layer in cavities restored with grandio flow and z250 , indicating nanoleakage occurred . this study suggests that volumetric shrinkage in resin composites remains a problem . although some new technologies are trying to solve the problem of composite shrinkage , the bonding system used in this study did not achieve perfect sealing at the restoration / dentin interface . this might affect durability of the bond to dentin .	0
fracture resistance and gap formation of mod restorations : influence of restorative technique , bevel preparation and water storage .. this in vitro study evaluated the effect of technique , use of a bevel and thermal cycling on the fracture resistance and gap formation of resin composite mod restorations . fracture resistance was measured on standard mod cavities prepared in 100 upper premolars that were stored for 24 hours and 6 months with 1000 thermal cycles . subgroups ( n = 10 ) were : beveled or non - beveled preparations and direct restorations ( adper single bond / filtek z250 ) and indirect restorations ( prepolymerized filtek z250 cemented with rely xarc ). ten sound teeth and 10 specimens with mod preparations without restorations served as the positive and negative controls , respectively . the specimens were subjected to axial compression in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / minute . failure patterns were analyzed by stereomicroscopy ( 40x ). to evaluate gap presence or absence , proximal box cavities were prepared in 24 human third molars that were restored as described above . the specimens were evaluated under sem examination after 24 hours and six months . data were statistically analyzed by anova and multiple comparison tests at the 0 . 05 level of significance . after 24 hours , the beveled restorations exhibited higher fracture strength values than the non - beveled restorations , and all groups showed resistance similar or superior to sound teeth . after six months , the highest fracture resistance was obtained for beveled inlays and the lowest values were observed for direct restorations with butt joints . thermal cycling decreased fracture resistance in the majority of the groups . the main fracture pattern observed was cohesive failure in the material , but adhesive failures increased over time , especially in the non - beveled restorations . under sem examination , no difference was observed among the groups after 24 hours . however , after six months , the beveled restorations exhibited no gap formation . it was concluded that storage with thermal cycling decreased fracture resistance , bevels improved fracture resistance and , in general , indirect restorations were not superior to direct restorations .	0
adhesion to er : yag laser - prepared dentin after long - term water storage and thermocycling .. this in vitro study evaluated the microtensile bond strength of a resin composite to er : yag - prepared dentin after long - term storage and thermocycling . eighty bovine incisors were selected and their roots removed . the crowns were ground to expose superficial dentin . the samples were randomly divided according to cavity preparation method ( i - er : yag laser and ii - carbide bur ). subsequently , an etch & rinse adhesive system was applied and the samples were restored with a resin composite . the samples were subdivided according to time of water storage ( ws )/ number of thermocycles ( tc ) performed : a ) 24 hours ws / no tc ; b ) 7 days ws / 500 tc ; c ) 1 month ws / 2 , 000 tc ; d ) 6 months ws / 12 , 000 tc . the teeth were sectioned in sticks with a cross - sectional area of 1 . 0 - mm2 , which were loaded in tension in a universal testing machine . the data were subjected to two - way anova , scheffé and fisher ' s tests at a 5 % level . in general , the bur - prepared group displayed higher microtensile bond strength values than the laser - treated group . based on one - month water stbrage and 2 , 000 thermocycles , the performance of the tested adhesive system to er : yag - laser irradiated dentin was negatively affected ( group ic ), while adhesion of the bur - prepared group decreased only within six months of water storage combined with 12 , 000 thermocycles ( group iid ). it may be concluded that adhesion to the er : yag laser cavity preparation was more affected by the methods used for simulating degradation of the adhesive interface .	0

[ emergent treatment of source water contaminated by representative chemicals ].. emergent treatment of source water polluted by representative chemical bisphenol - a ( bpa ) and di - ethyl phthalate ( dep ) was researched . the results indicate that activated carbon adsorption could achieve high efficiencies to remove the two chemicals . the pseudo second - order adsorption kinetic model and elovich kinetic model can be used to describe the powdered activated carbon ( pac ) adsorption process of bpa and dep in raw water . in pilot test , 50 mg / l pac dosage can get the pollution concentration of 500 microg / l bpa or 3 . 3 mg / l dep comply with the requirement of water quality standard . the dynamic adsorption of carbon - sand filter was also studied , and removal efficiencies of bpa and dep were hardly influenced by their original concentrations and the filtering velocity among 5 . 1 - 15 . 3 m / h of carbon - sand filter . when pac adsorption was combined with carbon - sand filter , pac adsorption contributes most to removing pollution , and carbon - sand filter as the supplement of pac can strengthen safety . dep can ' t be oxidized by kmno4 or cl2 , but 850 microg / l bpa can be almost completely oxidized by 3 mg / l kmno4 and 1 . 5 mg / l cl2 . the oxidation products of bpa as well as their toxicity need further study . pac adsorption combined with 1 . 5 mg / l kmno4 preoxidation can ' t improve the removal efficiency of dep , but can improve bpa removal efficiency .	0
microleakage in overflared root canals restored with different fiber reinforced dowels .. this study evaluated microleakage in overflared root canals restored with four different types of adhesively - luted fiber - reinforced dowels : dt light post ( lp ), glassix ( gl ), ribbond ( rb ) and sticktech post ( st ). forty non - carious , single - rooted mandibular human premolars with straight root canals were prepared using a step - back technique and obturated with gutta - percha using lateral condensation . the restored roots were randomly divided into four groups ( n = 10 ). the root canals were overprepared , creating an overflared dowel space , and each dowel was adhesively luted using a total - etched adhesive ( single bond ) and dual - polymerizing luting agent ( relyx arc ). all specimens were thermal cycled 1000 times between 5 degrees c and 55 degrees c and stored in 2 % methylene - blue solution for one week . the teeth were cut horizontally into three consecutive sections : apical ( a ), middle ( m ) and coronal ( c ). each section was digitally photographed from the occlusal direction under a stereomicroscope . the images were transferred to a pc and stored in tiff format . for each image , dye penetration was estimated as the ratio of methylene - blue - infiltrated surface divided by total dentin surfaces . the data were compared and statistically analyzed using the kruskal - wallis test ( p <. 05 ). the mann - whitney u test was used to compute multiple pairwise comparisons to determine differences between the experimental groups ( p =. 083 ). dentin - luting agent fiber - reinforced dowel ( frd ) interfaces were evaluated under a scanning electron microscope . scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) showed detachment of the luting resin from the dentin surface in varying degrees in all specimens evaluated . all groups showed considerable leakage at the sections evaluated . significant differences were demonstrated between lp - rb for the apical and middle sections and between gl - rb , lp - rb and st - rb for the coronal sections ( p <. 0083 ). among the frds evaluated , the individually shaped polyethylene - reinforced dowel ( ribbond ) showed the least overall leakage .	0
[ performance of solar / s - doped tio2 on the decomposition of bisphenol a ].. removal efficiency and influencing factors of bisphenol a by the combined process of solar irradiation and s - doped tio2 were studied in detail , in which s - doped tio2 photo - catalyst with high activity was prepared by acid catalyzed hydrolysis method using thiourea as sulfur source . results showed that bisphenol a could be more effectively oxidized by the solar / s - doped tio2 process than by solar / tio2 process , whose removal effect were 79 % and 49 % after 30 min ' s irradiation , respectively . pseudo - first - order model could be used to simulate the oxidation process in which the degradation rate coefficients were independent of the initial concentration of bisphenol a . degradation rate could be greatly affected by the concentration of h2o2 , and the optimum concentration for the system of solar / s - doped tio2 was found to be 20 mg / l , which was 5 mg / l higher than that of solar / tio2 system . lower water ph favored the degradation of bisphenol a , whose degradation rate coefficients at ph 5 . 5 were about 50 % higher than that at ph 8 . 5 . humic acids decreased both the degradation rate of the two processes , and the influence could be fitted by second - order equation . in addition , solar / s - doped tio2 process was more easily affected , for the humic acids could not only compete with molecular bisphenol - a for radicals but also adsorb part of visible sunlight which can excite radical with tio2 .	0
dentin permeability : self - etching and one - bottle dentin bonding systems .. statement of problem : there are many bonding systems available , with or without a prior acid etch . the mechanisms differ from system to system . therefore it is important that the clinician know which are the most effective and which provide the best seal . purpose : this study measured the infiltration of physiological saline solution across dentin after application of self - etching or 1 - bottle dentin bonding systems . materials and methods : thirty - six extracted noncarious human third molars from patients 18 to 25 years old were used for this study . dentin disks were cut from crown segments parallel to the occlusal surface at the incisal portion of the pulp cavity . the 36 disks , each 1 mm thick , were divided into 6 groups ( n = 6 per group ), each of which received one of the following dentin bonding systems : optibond solo plus and excite , which have ethanol as the solvent ; prime & bond nt , which has acetone as the solvent ; single bond , which has a mixed solvent ; and clearfil se bond or prompt l - pop , both self - etching systems the hydraulic conductance , the volume of fluid transported across a known area of surface ( 0 . 28 cm ( 2 )) per unit time under a unit pressure gradient ( 200 cm h ( 2 ) o ), was analyzed for the self - etching and 1 - bottle dentin bonding systems with the flodec apparatus . both sides of each specimen were etched with 36 % phosphoric acid for 30 seconds . measurements were made every 30 seconds for 15 minutes . the initial measurement served as the reference value for each specimen . the measurements were repeated when a smear layer had been formed and , finally , after one of the 6 bonding systems had been applied . the data were analyzed by use of analysis of variance and a posteriori tests ( fischer ' s plsd , duncan ' s new multiple range ) with alpha =. 05 . results : the greatest mean reduction ( 40 %, p <. 05 ) in penetration was observed with the 4 products with conventional etching : optibond solo plus , single bond , excite , and prime & bond nt . the self - etching products were associated with reductions of 36 % ( clearfil se bond ) and 16 % ( prompt l pop ). standard deviations were high , 50 % of the mean value , except for the single bond group (- 42 +/- 13 ) and prime & bond nt (- 41 +/- 14 ). conclusion : within the limitations of this study , the 4 bonding systems tested with a phosphoric acid before etching provided a greater decrease in dentin permeability than the 2 self - etching systems . the difference in permeability decrease was significant for prompt l - pop but not for clearfil se bond .	0
the fabrication of monolithic capillary column based on poly ( bisphenol a epoxy vinyl ester resin - co - ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ) and its applications for the separation of small molecules in high performance liquid chromatography .. a new polymeric monolith was synthesized in fused - silica capillary by in situ polymerization technique . in the polymerization , bisphenol a epoxy vinyl ester resin ( ver ) was used as the functional monomer , ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( edma ) as the crosslinking monomer , 1 , 4 - butanediol , 1 - propanol and water as the co - porogens , and azobisisobutyronitrile ( aibn ) as the initiator . the conditions of polymerization have been optimized . morphology of the prepared poly ( ver - co - edma ) monolith was investigated by the scanning electron microscopy ( sem ); pore properties were assayed by mercury porosimetry and nitrogen adsorption . the optimized poly ( ver - co - edma ) monolith showed a uniform structure , good permeability and mechanical stability . then , the column was used as the stationary phase of high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) to separate the mixture of benzene derivatives . the best column efficiency achieved for phenol was 235790 theoretical plates per meter . baseline separations of benzene derivatives and halogenated benzene compounds under optimized isocratic mode conditions were achieved with high column efficiency . the column showed good reproducibility : the relative standard deviation ( rsd ) values based on the retention times ( n = 3 ) for run - to - run , column - to - column and batch - to - batch were less than 0 . 98 , 1 . 68 , 5 . 48 %, respectively . compared with poly ( bma - co - edma ) monolithic column , the proposed monolith exhibited more efficiency in the separation of small molecules .	0
surfactants as part of a combined etchant and activator solution prior to the use of an anaerobic adhesive .. objectives : the objectives of this experiment were to determine whether the incorporation of a surfactant into a combined etchant and activator solution would further promote the polymerization of an anaerobic adhesive . method : stainless steel attachments were bonded to human enamel using an anaerobic adhesive . in each case the enamel was etched and activated using a solution of 37 % o - phosphoric acid containing copper ( ii ) sulphates or chlorides with one of three surfactants also within the solution . after bench curing , the specimens were shear bond tested to failure and the load at debond recorded in each case . results : the results were analysed using kaplan - meier survival probabilities and log - rank tests along with a multiple comparison test , using bonferroni ' s method . conclusions : under the conditions of this experiment the addition of a surfactant to a combined etchant activator solution of 37 % o - phosphoric acid and either copper ( ii ) sulphate or copper ( ii ) chloride , prior to the use of an anaerobic adhesive can have a significant effect on measured force to debond . however , with copper ( ii ) sulphate the highest force to debond was observed with the control solution without a surfactant . with copper ( ii ) chloride the surfactant tween 20 increased the observed force to debond but the effect was not statistically significant . significance : although it is possible to render the enamel surface both retentive and active towards anaerobic adhesives using a combined etchant and activator solution , the addition of a surfactant has little or no beneficial effect .	0
influence of chemical structures of benzodioxole - based coinitiators on the properties of the unfilled dental resin .. to investigate the influence of chemical structures of benzodioxole - based coinitiator on the initiating reactivity and the mechanical properties of cured samples for the unfilled dental resin , a mixture of 2 , 2 - bis [ 4 -( 2 - hydroxy - 3 - methacryloxyprop - 1 - oxy ) phenyl ] propane ( bis - gma ) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( tegdma ) ( 70 / 30 wt .%) was photoinduced by combinations of camphorquinone ( cq ) and benzodioxole derivatives . 2 -( n , n - dimethylamino ) ethyl methacrylate ( dmem ) was used as control . the kinetics was monitored by a real - time fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) and the dynamic mechanical analysis was performed on a dynamic mechanical analyzer ( dma ). the cytotoxicity property of the cured samples was evaluated by mtt assay in vitro using vero as reference cell lines . the results indicated that the 4 - position phenyl ring substituents of the benzodioxole - based coinitiator had great influence on the initiating reactivity . incorporating substituents with pi electron acceptors in the 4 - position of phenyl ring led to the decrease of the rate of polymerization ( r ( p )) of the cq / benzodioxole derivatives . however , the electron - donating substituents were useful to increase the reactivity . when compared with cq / amine initiating systems , the combination of cq and benzodioxole compounds caused lower r ( p ) but the comparable final double bond conversion . all the cured films initiated by cq / benzodioxole derivatives had almost the same glass transition temperature ( t ( g )) and storage modulus . indirect cytotoxicity assessment indicated low cytotoxicity of benzodioxole derivatives . these results were very useful for the design of benzodioxole derivatives with satisfactory reactivity and biocompatibility , and are very important for clinical applications .	0
mechanical properties of resin cements with different activation modes .. dual - cured cements have been studied in terms of the hardness or degree of conversion achieved with different curing modes . however , little emphasis is given to the influence of the curing method on other mechanical properties . this study investigated the flexural strength , flexural modulus and hardness of four proprietary resin cements . materials tested were : enforce and variolink ii ( light -, self - and dual - cured ), relyx arc ( self - and dual - cured ) and c & b ( self - cured ). specimens were fractured using a three - point bending test . pre - failure loads corresponding to specific displacements of the cross - head were used for flexural modulus calculation . knoop hardness ( khn ) was measured on fragments obtained after the flexural test . tests were performed after 24 h storage at 37 degrees c . relyx arc dual - cured showed higher flexural strength than the other groups . relyx arc and variolink ii depended upon photo - activation to achieve higher hardness values . enforce showed similar hardness for dual - and self - curing modes . no correlation was found between flexural strength and hardness , indicating that other factors besides the degree of cure ( e . g . filler content and monomer type ) affect the flexural strength of composites . no statistical difference was detected in the flexural modulus among the different groups .	0
monomer permeability of disposable dental gloves .. statement of problem : studies have suggested that monomers may be able to permeate dental gloves . purpose : this study examined the permeability of disposable dental gloves to 6 kinds of dental monomers . material and methods : the permeability of 6 kinds of dental monomers ( methyl methacrylate [ mma ], 2 - hydroxyethyl methacrylate [ hema ], triethyleneglycol methacrylate [ tegdma ], ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate [ egdma ], urethane dimethacrylate [ udma ], and bis - glycidyl methacrylate [ bis - gma ]) through 5 kinds of dental gloves ( latex , powder - free latex , coated latex , polychloroprene , and polyvinyl chloride ) was examined for up to 180 minutes at 37 degrees c . the fingers of unused gloves without pin holes were cut and used in the experiments . five specimens per test group were examined . one type of monomer was poured into each finger and dipped in ethanol . the ethanol for extraction was measured by a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 210 nm , and the results were analyzed by analysis of variance and the kruskal - wallis test ( p <. 05 ). results : four of the monomers tested ( mma , hema , tegdma , and egdma ) permeated the gloves tested , whereas 2 ( udma and bis - gma ) did not ( p >. 01 ). the amount of monomers permeating the latex in 10 minutes was 0 . 8 +/- 0 . 6 , 0 . 6 +/- 0 . 6 , 0 . 07 +/- 0 . 1 , 0 . 07 +/- 0 . 1 , 0 . 1 +/- 0 . 1 and 0 . 06 +/- 0 . 1 microl / ml for mma , hema , egdma , tegdma , udma , and bis - gma , respectively . the amount of permeated monomer was then increased in relation to the examination time , and in mma and hema , permeation occurred rapidly during the initial 60 minutes at 3 times the 10 - minute values , then continued gradually and linearly . the polyvinyl chloride glove showed the greatest monomer permeability . two - way analysis of variance showed significant correlations between mma , hema , egdma or tegdma and udma or bis - gma ( p <. 01 ). statistical significance was shown between polyvinyl chloride and latex , powder - free latex , coated latex or polychloroprene ( p <. 01 ). however , there was no significant relation between any kind of dental monomer and any kind of dental glove . conclusion : within the limitations of this study , 4 of the monomers tested permeated all of the gloves tested .	0
daily urinary excretion of bisphenol a .. objectives : concerns over dietary exposure to bisphenol a ( bpa ), an endocrine disruptor , have been raised because bpa is contained in resins and plastics commonly used for the preservation of food and beverages . the purpose of the present study was to assess daily intake levels of bpa in a group of male subjects by measuring total urinary bpa ( free bpa plus bpa released by treatment with β - glucuronidase ), as well as determining intra - individual variation in bpa excretion . methods : twenty - four - hour urine was collected from 5 subjects for 5 consecutive days for the evaluation of between - day variation in urinary bpa excretion and from 36 male subjects for the estimation of the level of daily bpa intake . bpa in the urine samples was measured by gc / ms / ms following enzymatic hydrolysis of bpa glucuronate , solid phase extraction , and derivatization . results : a large between - day variation was found over 5 days for the daily excretion of urinary bpa in the 5 subjects . the daily excretion of urinary bpa was distributed log - normally in the 36 male subjects , with the median value being 1 . 2 μg / day ( range : < 0 . 21 - 14 μg / day ), which was far below the tolerable daily intake ( 0 . 01 mg / kg bw ) recommended by a scientific committee in the european commission in 2002 . however , the maximum estimated intake per body weight ( 0 . 2 μg / kg / day ) was only one order of magnitude lower than the reported lowest level for reproductive / behavioral effects in pregnant mice ( 2 μg / kg / day ). conclusions : measuring urinary bpa in urine is a suitable approach for estimating short - term bpa intake levels in individuals and / or estimating the average exposure level of populations . urine analyses will be increasingly important in the human health risk assessment of bpa .	0
towards the elucidation of shrinkage stress development and relaxation in dental composites .. objective : although various photo - curing techniques aiming to partially relieve the shrinkage stress by flow have been proposed and investigated , the direct monitoring and observation of stress relaxation behavior received little attention . in this study , the elucidation of stress relaxation behavior and its impact on the overall stress development were investigated . methods : a novel experimental set - up capable of real - time , simultaneous shrinkage stress and double bond conversion measurements on the same sample was utilized . the coupled shrinkage stress and conversion for specimens of a barium glass filled bis - gma / tegdma composite were continuously monitored during and after irradiation for various intervals ( 2 , 3 , 6 , 10 and 60s ). results : specimens irradiated for 60s reached the highest conversion ( 67 . 9 +/- 1 . 2 %) and shrinkage stress ( 2 . 9 +/- 0 . 1 mpa ). shrinkage stress relaxation phenomena were only observed prior to vitrification , which only applied to specimens partially cured for 2 or 3 s ; specimens irradiated for 2 s exhibit the largest capability to relieve stress ( approximately 40 %). however , to achieve this a much longer post - cure stress relaxation time is required as compared to clinically practical time scales . for specimens irradiated for 6 , 10 or 60 s , the majority of the shrinkage stress is developed during and after the vitrification stage , and no appreciable stress relaxation can be observed . significance : although stress relaxation prior to vitrification stage has been observed , this study revealed that it did not provide a significant benefit towards the reduction of overall shrinkage stress since , to achieve clinically relevant conversion , the majority of the shrinkage stress is developed during and after the vitrification stage , which does not permit stress relaxation on the time scales used in this study .	0
enzymatic determination of bpa by means of tyrosinase immobilized on different carbon carriers .. different tyrosinase carbon paste modified electrodes to determine bisphenol a ( bpa ) concentration in aqueous solutions have been constructed . variables examined were in the carbon paste composition and in particular : ( i ) the immobilized enzyme amount ; ( ii ) the carbon type ( powder , single or multi - walled nanotubes ); ( iii ) the nature of the pasting oil ( mineral oil , hexadecane and dodecane ). for each biosensor type the amperometric response was evaluated with reference to the linear range and sensitivity . constant reference has been made to the amperometric signals obtained , under the same experimental conditions , towards the catechol , a specific phenolic substrate for tyrosinase . the most efficient biosensors were those constructed by using the following composition for the carbon paste : 10 % of tyrosinase , 45 % of single wall carbon nanotubes ( swcn ) and 45 % of mineral oil . this biosensor formulation displayed the following electrochemical characteristics : a sensitivity equal to 138 microa / mm , lod of 0 . 02 microm ( based on three times the s / n ratio ), linear range of 0 . 1 - 12 microm and response time of 6 min . this experimental work represents a first attempt at construction of a new carbon nanotube - tyrosinase based biosensor able to determine the concentration of bpa , one of the most ubiquitous and hazardous endocrine disruptors which can pollute the drinking and surface water , as well as many products of the food chain .	0

shear bond strength of some sealants under saliva contamination .. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the shear bond strength of different types of sealant to non - contaminated and saliva - contaminated enamel . the buccal surfaces of 60 sound permanent third molars were individually embedded in self - curing acrylic resin and wet ground with 1 , 000 - grit silicone carbide paper to obtain a flat enamel surface . the specimens were randomly assigned to one of three groups : 1 ) non - fluoride - releasing resin sealant ( concise ), 2 ) fluoride - releasing resin sealant ( clinpro ), 3 ) glass - ionomer sealant ( fuji vii ). each group was divided into 2 subgroups ( n = 10 ): non - contaminated and saliva contaminated with 0 . 02 ml of fresh human saliva for 20 seconds and then blowed dried prior to sealant placement . all samples were thermocycled 2 , 000 cycles . the specimens were tested using an instron running at a crosshead speed of 0 . 05 mm / min . stereomicroscope examinations were carried out to evaluate failure sites of the sealants . data were analyzed with one - way anova and the turkey test at a siginificance level of p < 0 . 05 . comparison of the different types of sealant revealed the shear bond strength of the glass - ionomer sealant was the same for the non - contaminated and saliva - contaminated subgroups . the shear bond strength was lower in both the fluoride and non - fluoride releasing resin - based sealant groups contaminated with saliva than in the fluoride and non - fluoride releasing resin - based sealant groups not contaminated with saliva . comparison of the different types of sealant also revealed the shear bond strength of the glass - ionomer sealant had a significantly lower shear bond strength than the fluoride and non - fluoride releasing resin - based sealant groups for both the non - contaminated and saliva - contaminated subgroups . the fluoride and non - fluoride releasing resin - based sealant groups were not significantly different from each other . the modes of failure were mostly mixed with the glass - ionomer sealant in both the non - contaminated and saliva - contaminated subgroups of this sealant . the resin - based sealant groups ( both fluoride and non - fluoride releasing ) had cohesive / mixed failure in the non - contaminated and adhesive / mixed failure in the saliva - contaminated subgroups . in conclusion , saliva - contamiantion did not affect the shear bond strength of glass - ionomer sealant but the glass - ionomer sealant had the lowest shear bond strength .	0
protection by latex or vinyl gloves against cytotoxicity of direct bonding adhesives .. the cytotoxicity of orthodontic bonding agents ( obas ) has been demonstrated in both animal and in vitro studies . many practitioners and their assistants have experienced contact dermatitis of the fingers following contact with oba . latex gloves have also been reported to cause similar symptoms in several reports . the purpose of this study was to evaluate and quantify the toxic effects of latex and vinyl gloves , several obas , and combinations of these in vitro to determine the kind of glove that should by worn by practitioners when manipulating an oba . it was determined that when obas are applied to washed latex , the combined toxic effect on cultured cells exceeded that of the washed gloves alone . however , when vinyl glove material instead of latex was tested , the toxic effects decreased more than 50 %. therefore , we suggest that practitioners who experience contact dermatitis in orthodontic practices wear vinyl gloves instead of latex , especially when manipulating obas . we also acknowledge the need for further research on the subject .	0
removal of selected endocrine disrupters in activated sludge systems : effect of sludge retention time on their sorption and biodegradation .. the fate of three endocrine - disrupting compounds ( edcs ), namely 4 - n - nonylphenol ( 4 - n - np ), triclosan ( tcs ) and bisphenol a ( bpa ), was studied in activated sludge process . the effect of sludge retention time ( srt ) on their sorption and biodegradation was also investigated . three continuous - flow activated sludge systems were used , operating at srt of 3 , 10 and 20 days , respectively . batch experiments with biomass originated from the aforementioned systems showed that 4 - n - np and tcs are significantly sorbed on the suspended solids , while bpa to a lesser extent . the sorption affinity of target compounds did not seem to be affected by srt , with the exception of 4 - n - np for which higher values of sorption coefficients were calculated at srt of 3 days . the operation of continuous - flow systems in the presence of 10 - 40 microgl (- 1 ) of edcs indicated that more than 90 %, 94 % and 97 % of bpa , tcs and 4 - n - np , respectively , can be removed during the activated sludge process in systems operating at srt of 3 - 20 days . determination of edcs in the dissolved and particulate phase and calculation of their mass flux revealed that biodegradation was the principal removal mechanism of edcs . for srt values used in this study , this parameter does not seem to affect significantly percentage biodegradation of bpa . on the other hand , biodegradation of 4 - n - np and tcs was enhanced at srt of 20 days . calculation of biotransformation rates showed that the highest values for all edcs were calculated at srt of 3 days .	0
comprehensive two - dimensional liquid chromatography and hyphenated liquid chromatography to study the degradation of poly ( bisphenol a ) carbonate .. size exclusion chromatography ( sec ), gradient polymer elution chromatography ( gpec ) and liquid chromatography at critical conditions ( lc - cc ) have been developed and applied to observe chemical changes in poly ( bisphenol a ) carbonate ( pc ) due to hydrolytic degradation . especially lc - cc appeared to be very successful to observe differences in functionality of pc as result of hydrolytic degradation . observed differences due to degradation could be identified by ( semi ) on - line coupling to matrix assisted laser desorption - ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof - ms ). the differences in functionality could be attributed to the formation of different end - groups , i . e . oh end - groups . in addition , comprehensive two - dimensional liquid chromatography ( 2d - lc ) has been applied successfully to study the hydrolytic degradation of pc . lc - cc x sec showed that the formation of pc with different end - groups occurred over the whole molecular mass range . this information could not be obtained with the separate liquid chromatographic techniques , thereby illustrating the added value of 2d - lc .	0
effect of two axial wall height preparations on the retentive properties of full crowns using three different cements .. this study evaluated how different tooth preparation heights and luting cements affected the retention of metallic full crowns . tooth preparations were made on 60 extracted maxillary premolars with occluso - cervical heights of 4 . 0 or 5 . 0 mm . the nickel chromium ( nicr ) metallic crowns in each group were subdivided randomly into three groups ( n = 10 ); the samples in each group were cemented with either a self - adhesive resin cement , a conventional resin cement , or a zinc phosphate cement . cementation was performed by applying 5 . 0 kg pressure in 50 % relative humidity . specimens were stored in 100 % humidity at 37 degrees c for seven days , at which time they were subjected to a vertical tensile test with a universal testing machine at 0 . 5 mm / min . data ( kgf ) were analyzed by two - way anova and tukey ' s multiple comparisons tests ( alpha = 0 . 01 ). there was a significant difference in mean force in the height preparations ( p < 0 . 001 ) and in tensile strength ( p < 0 . 001 ) among the resin cements . regardless of the cement used , 5 . 0 mm high preparations showed significantly higher mean forces than the 4 . 0 mm high preparations . the self - adhesive resin cement showed significantly higher mean tensile strength than the conventional resin cement ; the zinc phosphate cement displayed the lowest retention values . the self - adhesive resin cement displayed retention rates twice that of the zinc phosphate cement .	0
heterogeneous distribution of single - bottle adhesive monomers in the resin - dentin interdiffusion zone .. objectives : the purpose of this study was to investigate whether monomer separation occurs in single - bottle adhesives applied on acid - etched dentin surfaces . methods : smear - layer covered dentin specimens produced from sound premolars , were acid - etched and analyzed by micro - mir ftir spectroscopy , before and after treatment with the single - bottle adhesives one - step , prime and bond 2 . 1 , scotchbond 1 and syntac - sprint . the difference spectra ( etched , and primed minus etched of the same dentin surfaces ) were plotted and compared with original adhesive spectra . the c = c / c ... c ( aromatic adhesives ) and c = c / c = o ( aliphatic adhesives ) peak area ratios were used to evaluate the extent of monomer separation relative to original adhesive spectra at the uppermost 2 microm of the resin - dentin interdiffusion zone . three dentin specimens were used for each adhesive . one - way anova and newman - keuls tests were performed to assess the statistically significant differences ( alpha = 0 . 05 ). results : all the adhesives demonstrated separation of monomer components on etched dentin ranging in mean values from 68 . 7 to 81 . 9 % relative to reference . high molecular weight hydrophobic ( i . e . bisdma , bisgma , bisgma adducts ) and hydrophilic monomers ( i . e . bpdma ) predominated at the region probed . prime and bond 2 . 1 demonstrated the highest extent of monomer separation . significance : heterogeneous monomer distribution following application to etched dentin may affect the curing performance of single - bottle adhesives within the resin infiltrated region and consequently , the mechanical and chemical stability of the network formed .	0
preparation of polyethersulfone - organophilic montmorillonite hybrid particles for the removal of bisphenol a .. polyethersulfone ( pes )- organophilic montmorillonite ( ommt ) hybrid particles , with various proportions of ommt , were prepared by using a liquid - liquid phase separation technique , and then were used for the removal of bisphenol a ( bpa ) from aqueous solution . the adsorbed bpa amounts increased significantly when the ommt were embedded into the particles . the structure of the particle was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ); and these particles hardly release small molecules below 250 degrees c which was testified by using thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ). the experimental data of bpa adsorption were adequately fitted with langmuir equations . three simplified kinetics model including the pseudo - first - order ( lagergren equation ), the pseudo - second - order , and the intraparticle diffusion model were used to describe the adsorption process . kinetic studies showed that the adsorbed bpa amount reached an equilibrium value after 300 min , and the experimental data could be expressed by the intraparticular mass transfer diffusion model . furthermore , the adsorbed bpa could be effectively removed by ethanol , which indicated that the hybrid particles could be reused . these results showed that the pes - ommt hybrid particles have the potential to be used in the environmental application .	0
ovariectomized mouse uterotrophic assay of 36 chemicals .. the concern over endocrine disruptors prompted international establishment of a strategic framework for the identification of the estrogenic compounds . oecd has launched the conceptual framework tool box containing various screening and testing methods including the uterotrophic assay . the ( anti ) estrogenicity of 36 chemicals suspected to be estrogen - receptor interactive by in silico and / or in vitro screening in the extended scheme for endocrine disruptor screening and testing of the ministry of health , labour and welfare , japan , were monitored by the uterotrophic assay using c57bl / 6j ovariectomized adult female mice after a 7 - day exposure by oral gavage ( po ) and subcutaneous injection ( sc ). ethynyl estradiol was used as reference for agonist and antagonist detection . in addition , bisphenol a ( sc ) and genistein ( po ) were tested for the comparison to rat assays . among the 36 , 2 -[ bis ( 4 - hydroxy - phenyl ) methyl ] benzylalcohol , 2 , 2 ', 4 , 4 '- tetrahydroxybenzophenone , 2 , 4 - dihydroxybenzophenone , 3 , 3 ', 5 - triiodothyroacetic acid , new fuchsin and alpha - naphtholbenzein , showed both estrogenic agonistic and antagonistic activities ; first two showed u - shaped dose - response in antagonistic studies . n , n - diphenyl - p - phenylenediamine , 2 , 2 '- dihydroxy - 4 , 4 '- dimethoxybenzophenone , n - butyl 4 - hydroxybenzoate , and reserpine were agonistic by sc . benzo [ a ] pyrene , benz [ a ] anthracene , dibenz [ a , h ] anthracene , 2 -( 2h - benzotriazol - 2 - yl )- 4 , 6 - di ( t - pentyl ) phenol , rosemarinic acid , meta - thymol , 6 - gingerol , colchicine , malachite green base , fenbuconazole , and lead acetate were antagonistic . the rest , i . e . n - heptyl 4 - hydroxybenzoate , tetrazolium violet , pravastatin sodium salt , physostigmine , salicylate ( 1 : 1 ), nordihydroguaiaretic acid , o - cresolphthalein , 1 , 3 - dinitrobenzene , c . i . pigment orange , tetrabromobis - phenol - a , 2 - hydroxy - 4 - methoxybenzophenone , ethylparaben , propyl p - hydroxybenzoate , kaempferol , 2 -( 2 - benzotriazolyl )- p - cresol and phenolphthalein were negative for both effects . taking together with in silico / in vitro screening , the result suggested that the ovariectomized mouse uterotrophic bioassay has sufficient performance comparable to rat for the screening of ( anti ) estrogenicity of various chemicals .	0

bond strength of luting cement to casting and soldering alloy .. adjustment of metal alloy framework of the porcelain - fused - to - metal crown by soldering minor marginal deficiences prior insertion may sometimes be needed . the aim of this study was to compare shear bond strengths of four luting cements to casting metal alloy and soldering metal alloy . a total of 64 flame cast non - precious metal alloy and flame soldered metal alloy samples were used . durelon , panavia f , relyx unicem applicap and relyx arc stubs were bonded to the alloy substrate surface . after stored in water at 37 degrees c for 1 week , shear bond strength of the cement to the alloy was measured . differences were analyzed using one way anova ( p < 0 . 05 ). there were no difference between the cast metal alloy and soldering metal alloy substrate .	0
octylphenol stimulates resistin gene expression in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes via the estrogen receptor and extracellular signal - regulated kinase pathways .. resistin is known as an adipocyte - specific secretory hormone that can cause insulin resistance and decrease adipocyte differentiation . it can be regulated by sexual hormones . whether environmental estrogens regulate the production of resistin is still not clear . using 3t3 - l1 adipocytes , we found that octylphenol upregulated resistin mrna expression in dose - and time - dependent manners . the concentration of octylphenol that increased resistin mrna levels by 50 % was approximately 100 nm within 6 h of treatment . the basal half - life of resistin mrna induced by actinomycin d was lengthened by octylphenol treatment , suggesting that octylphenol decreases the rate of resistin mrna degradation . in addition , octylphenol stimulated resistin protein expression and release . the basal half - life of resistin protein induced by cycloheximide was lengthened by octylphenol treatment , suggesting that octylphenol decreases the rate of resistin protein degradation . while octylphenol was shown to increase activities of the estrogen receptor ( er ) and mek1 , signaling was demonstrated to be blocked by pretreatment with either ici - 182780 ( an eralpha antagonist ) or u - 0126 ( a mek1 inhibitor ), in which both inhibitors prevented octylphenol - stimulated phosphorylation of erk . these results imply that eralpha and erk are necessary for the octylphenol stimulation of resistin mrna expression . moreover , u - 0126 antagonized the octylphenol - increased resistin protein expression and release . these data suggest that the way octylphenol signaling increases resistin protein levels is similar to that by which it increases resistin mrna levels ; it is likely mediated through an erk - dependent pathway . in vivo , octylphenol increased adipose resistin mrna expression and serum resistin and glucose levels , supporting its in vitro effect .	1
neurotoxic effects of fifth - generation dentin adhesives on rat sciatic nerve .. this study evaluated the effect of the fifth - generation dentin adhesives , single bond ( sb ), excite ( ex ), prime & bond nt ( pb ), and optibond solo ( os ) on nerve conduction . isolated rat sciatic nerves were placed between two suction electrodes in a bath containing tyrode solution . the bonding agents were brought into contact with the nerves and the evoked compound action potentials ( caps ) were recorded before and after contact with the materials . sb , ex , and pb caused total inhibition of the caps , with pb being the fastest ( 73 +/- 5 . 8 min ). all caps except one in the pb group were irreversibly inhibited in the sb , ex , and pb groups . as for os the reduction in cap was not 50 % after an application time of 200 min . recovery of the caps in this group was recorded in an average time of 35 min .	0
preparation of functionalized magnetic nanoparticulate sorbents for rapid extraction of biphenolic pollutants from environmental samples .. a new solid - phase extraction coupled with magnetic carrier technology was developed for extraction of bisphenol a ( bpa ) and diethylstilbestrol ( des ) from water samples . the spe sorbents , functionalized magnetic nanoparticles ( fe3o4 @ sio2 / beta - cd , core / shell ), were synthesized in a two - stage system . the material was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , transmission electron microscopy , and a vibrating sample magnetometer . spe extraction parameters , such as volume and ph of sample , adsorption time , and desorption conditions were optimized . under selected conditions : 250 ml of water sample , 0 . 1 g of sorbents and elution with methanol ( 3 ml with 1 % acetic acid ), the extraction was completed in 25 min . spe followed by hplc was employed to determine bpa and des in environmental samples . the developed method provided spiked recoveries of 80 - 105 %, relative standard deviations of less than 7 %, and lod of bpa ( 20 . 0 ng / l ) and des ( 23 . 0 ng / l ), respectively . the proposed method offered easy preparation of sorbents , rapid analysis , high enrichment yields , and reliable quantitative assay .	0
bioaccumulation and metabolism of [ 14c ] bisphenol a in the brackish water bivalve corbicula japonica .. the brackish water bivalve mollusk corbicula japonica was exposed to brackish water containing approximately 9 microg / l [( 14 ) c ] bisphenol a ( bpa ) for 168 h ( the uptake phase ), and subsequently transferred to clean brackish water for 144 h ( the depuration phase ) under semi - static conditions . mono and disulfate conjugates of bpa were detected in the bivalves as major metabolites . at the end of the uptake phase , the visceral mass contained the highest ( 14 ) c - concentration , and the monosulfate conjugate of bpa was a major metabolite in the visceral mass . these data suggest that the visceral mass is the major tissue / organ to take up and metabolize bpa in these bivalves . the bpa concentration in the bivalves readily reached steady state during the uptake phase and immediately decreased in the depuration phase . the accumulation and elimination rates of the mono and disulfate conjugates of bpa were slower than those of bpa .	0
effects of endocrine disruptors on arachidonic acid metabolism in rabbit platelets .. to explore the possible actions of endocrine disruptors on the autacoid synthesis in the body , we investigated the effects of nonylphenol ( np ), bisphenol a ( bpa ), di - n - butyl phthalate ( dbp ), benzyl - n - butyl phthalate ( bbp ), and di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ( dehp ) on the formation of 12 - lipoxygenase metabolite , 12 - hete , and cyclooxygenase metabolites , txb ( 2 ) and 12 - hht , from exogenous arachidonic acid ( aa ) in rabbit platelets . np ( 10 - 50 microm ) showed strong inhibition on the formation of cyclooxygenase metabolites ( txb ( 2 ), 34 - 95 % inhibition ; 12 - hht , 13 - 78 % inhibition ) and weaker inhibition on the formation of 12 - hete ( 0 - 49 % inhibition ). bpa , dbp , bbp , dehp , and 17beta - estradiol ( endogenous estrogen ) failed to show any effect on the formation of cyclooxygenase and 12 - lipoxygenase metabolites at concentrations up to 100 microm . these results suggest that np inhibits aa metabolism in platelets and that its effects on the cyclooxygenase pathway predominate over those exerted via the 12 - lipoxygenase pathway .	0
photocatalytic decomposition of bisphenol a in water using composite tio2 - zeolite sheets prepared by a papermaking technique .. titanium dioxide ( tio2 ) photocatalyst and zeolite adsorbent were made into a paper - like composite by a papermaking technique using pulp and ceramic fibers as sheet matrix . the photocatalytic performance for the degradation of bisphenol a ( bpa ) dissolved in water was investigated under uv irradiation . the tio2 sheet prepared was easier to handle than the original tio2 powders in aqueous media . the tio2 sheet could decompose the bpa under uv irradiation , although at a lower degradation efficiency than the tio2 suspension . the tio2 - free zeolite sheet could not remove the bpa from water completely because of its adsorption equilibrium . furthermore , the composite tio2 - zeolite sheets exhibited a higher efficiency for bpa removal than the zeolite - free tio2 sheets , the efficiency of the former being equivalent to that of the tio2 suspension . the enhancement in removal efficiency was not attributed to the simple adsorption of bpa on zeolite but rather to the synergistic effect obtained through the combined use of tio2 photocatalyst and zeolite adsorbent in the paper - like composite sheet , which is believed to accelerate the bpa photodegradation in water .	0

characterization of estrogen - responsive transgenic marine medaka oryzias dancena germlines harboring red fluorescent protein gene under the control by endogenous choriogenin h promoter .. transgenic marine medaka ( oryzias dancena ) germlines were generated by the microinjection of the red fluorescent protein ( rfp ) reporter gene ( rfp ) driven by the endogenous choriogenin h gene ( chgh ) promoter . the selected transgenic lines contained multiple copies of the transgene ( 3 - 42 copies per cell ) in their genomes . although all the founders were mosaic , the transgene was stably transmitted from the f1 generation to all subsequent generations following a mendelian pattern . different transgenic lines showed different responsiveness to estradiol - 17β ( e2 ) exposure at the mrna and protein levels , and the expression efficiency was dependent upon the transgene copy number . the induction of rfp was significantly affected by the developmental stage of transgenic larvae : later - stage larvae ( older than 7 days post - hatching ) showed higher sensitivity to e2 exposure than earlier - stage larvae . the response of transgenic expression to e2 was fairly dependent upon the e2 dose ( 200 - 3 , 200 ng / l ) and exposure period ( 1 - 7 days ), according to both a microscopic examination of rfp intensity and a qrt - pcr assay . the transgenic marine medaka showed similar transgenic responses to e2 under freshwater , brackish , and seawater conditions . in addition to e2 , the transgenic rfp signal was also successfully induced during 1 - week exposure to various other natural ( 1 μg / l estrone and 10 μg / l estriol ) and synthetic ( xeno ) estrogens ( 0 . 1 μg / l 17α - ethynylestradiol , 1 μg / l diethylstilbestrol , and 10 mg / l bisphenol a ). the efficiency of transgene expression varied greatly among the chemicals tested . the results of this study suggest that the chgh - rfp transgenic marine medaka species will be useful in the in vivo detection of waterborne estrogens under a wide range of salinity conditions .	0
monitoring of environmental phenolic endocrine disrupting compounds in treatment effluents and river waters , korea .. the last two decades have witnessed growing scientific and public concerns over endocrine disrupting compounds ( edcs ) that have the potential to alter the normal structure or functions of the endocrine system in wildlife and humans . in this study , the phenolic edcs such as alkylphenol , chlorinated phenol and bisphenol a were considered . they are commonly found in wastewater discharges and in sewage treatment plant . in order to monitor the levels and seasonal variations of phenolic edcs in various aquatic environments , a total of 15 water samples from the discharged effluent from sewage and wastewater treatment plants and river water were collected for 3 years . ten environmental phenolic edcs were determined by gc - ms and laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ). gc - ms analysis revealed that most abundant phenolic edcs were 4 - n - heptylphenol , followed by nonlyphenol and bisphenol a during 2002 - 2003 , while 4 - t - butylphenol and 4 - t - octylphenol were newly detected in aquatic environments in 2004 . the category of phenolic edcs showed similar fluorescence spectra and nearly equal fluorescence decay time . this makes it hard to distinguish each phenolic edc from the edcs mixture by lif . therefore , the results obtained from lif analysis were expressed in terms of the fluorescence intensity of the total phenolic edcs rather than that of the individual edc . however , lif monitoring and gc - ms analysis showed consistent result in that the river water samples had lower phenolic edcs concentration compared to the effluent sample . this revealed a lower fluorescence intensity and the phenolic edcs concentration in summer was lower than that in winter . for the validation of lif monitoring for the phenolic edcs , the correlation between edcs concentration acquired from gc - ms and fluorescence intensity from lif was obtained ( r = 0 . 7379 ). this study supports the feasibility of the application of lif into edcs monitoring in aquatic systems .	0
development of biomarkers of stress related to endocrine disruption in gastropods : alkali - labile phosphates , protein - bound lipids and vitellogenin - like proteins .. the occurrence in aquatic environments of compounds capable of acting as endocrine disruptors ( ed ) is of concern for wildlife . elevated levels of the egg - yolk precursor protein vitellogenin ( vg ) are widely accepted as a biomarker for xenoestrogen exposure in aquatic organisms . the purpose of this study was to develop a method for tracking changes in levels of vg - like proteins in gastropods . vg - like and egg - yolk proteins were analyzed in three freshwater gastropods having different modes of reproduction : potamopyrgus antipodarum ( asexual reproduction ), valvata piscinalis ( hermaphroditism ) and lithoglyphus naticoides ( sexual reproduction ). vitellogenin - like protein levels were examined by the alkali - labile phosphate ( alp ) technique , a novel protein - bound lipid ( pbl ) assay , and by gradient gel electrophoresis with silver staining . the first phase of the study was dedicated to the development and optimization of an analytical method for detecting vg - like proteins in these three gastropod species . in the second phase , the snails p . antipodarum and v . piscinalis were exposed to bisphenol a ( bpa ), octylphenol ( op ) and tributyltin ( tbt ) for 14 and 28 days . vg - like proteins were resolved in one major band at 250 - 300 kda for l . naticoides and v . piscinalis and in two bands at 100 and 30 kda for p . antipodarum . after 14 days of exposure , all techniques showed an increase in vg - like protein levels at 100 microg / l bpa and at 1 microg / l op in p . antipodarum . a decrease in these proteins was observed with high concentrations of op ( 100 microg / l ) and tbt (> or = 5 ng / l ). in v . piscinalis , a decrease in vg - like proteins was shown after 14 days of exposure for op > or = 10 microg / l and tbt > or = 5 ng / l ; however , at 28 days , gel electrophoresis revealed an increase in these proteins . histological observations showed significant necrosis in ovotestes of v . piscinalis with the three endocrine - disrupting compounds , while tissue modifications were not detected for p . antipodarum . a method for measuring vg - like and egg - yolk proteins is proposed to track changes in both estrogenic and androgenic endocrine disruptors in gastropods . the potential use of these species as bioindicators of endocrine disruption in freshwater environments in terms of their reproduction mode is discussed .	0
influence of bonding agents and composites on microleakage .. the compatibility of selected composite resins was compared with scotchbond dual cure adhesive . in addition , the influence of the types of composite resins on microleakage was investigated . no significant difference was found in microleakage of preparations restored with scotchbond dual cure adhesive and the five composite resins of other manufacturers from restorations inserted with the manufacturers bonding agent and composite resin . severe leakage occurred at the gingival dentinal margin in all restorations . however , leakage was greatly reduced when a less viscous microfilled composite resin was used in conjunction with various bonding agents . the findings of this study indicate that the higher viscosity and lower water - sorption values of some composite resins may adversely influence micro - leakage regardless of the bonding agent used .	0
